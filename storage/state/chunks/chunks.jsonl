From opinion \npolls to clinical trials in medicine and analysis of big data from health applications, \nstatistics influences and shapes the world around us. Biostatistics for the Health and \nBiological Sciences forges the relationship between statistics and our world through \nextensive use of a wide variety of real applications that bring life to theory and \nmethods.\nGoals of This Second Edition\n \n■Incorporate the latest and best methods used by professional statisticians.\n \n■Include features that address all of the recommendations included in the Guide-\nlines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) as recom-\nmended by the American Statistical Association.\n \n■Provide an abundance of new and interesting data sets, examples, and exercises.\n \n■Foster personal growth of students through critical thinking, use of technology, \ncollaborative work, and development of communication skills.\n \n■Enhance teaching and learning with the most extensive and best set of supple-\nments and digital resources.\nAudience, Prerequisites\nBiostatistics for the Health and Biological Sciences is written for students major-\ning in the biological and health sciences, and it is designed for a wide variety of \nstudents taking their first statistics course. Algebra is used minimally, and calculus \nis not required. It is recommended that students have completed at least an elemen-\ntary algebra course or that students should learn the relevant algebra components \nthrough an integrated or co-requisite course. In many cases, underlying theory is \nincluded, but this book does not require the mathematical rigor more appropriate for \nmathematics majors.\nHallmark Features\nGreat care has been taken to ensure that each chapter of Biostatistics for the Health \nand Biological Sciences will help students understand the concepts presented. The \nfollowing features are designed to help meet that objective.\nReal Data\nHundreds of hours have been devoted to finding data that are real, meaningful, and \ninteresting to students. Fully 87% of the examples are based on real data, and 89% of \nthe exercises are based on real data. Some exercises refer to the 18 data sets listed in \nAppendix B, and 12 of those data sets are new to this edition. Exercises requiring use \nof the Appendix B data sets are located toward the end of each exercise set and are \nmarked with a special data set icon \n.\nReal data sets are included throughout the book to provide relevant and interesting \nreal-world statistical applications, including biometric security, body measurements, \nbrain sizes and IQ scores, and data from births. Appendix B includes descriptions of \nvii\n","page_start":9,"page_end":9,"token_count":562,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":8}

Section 2-4 \nnow includes basic concepts of scatterplots, correlation, and regression without \nthe use of formulas and greater depth found in Sections 10-1 (Correlation) and \n10-2 (Regression).\n \n■Minimum Probability: Some instructors prefer extensive coverage of probability, \nwhile others prefer to include only basic concepts. Instructors preferring mini-\nmum coverage can include Section 4-1 while skipping the remaining sections of \nChapter 4, as they are not essential for the chapters that follow. Many instructors \nprefer to cover the fundamentals of probability along with the basics of the addi-\ntion rule and multiplication rule (Section 4-2).\nGAISE\nThis book reflects recommendations from the American Statistical Association and \nits Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE). Those \nguidelines suggest the following objectives and strategies.\n1. Emphasize statistical literacy and develop statistical thinking: Each section \nexercise set begins with Statistical Literacy and Critical Thinking exercises. \nMany of the book’s exercises are designed to encourage statistical thinking \nrather than the blind use of mechanical procedures.\n2. Use real data: 87% of the examples and 89% of the exercises use real data.\n3. Stress conceptual understanding rather than mere knowledge of procedures: \nInstead of seeking simple numerical answers, most exercises and examples \ninvolve conceptual understanding through questions that encourage practical \ninterpretations of results. Also, each chapter includes a From Data to Decision \nproject.\n4. Foster active learning in the classroom: Each chapter ends with several \nCooperative Group Activities.\n5. Use technology for developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data: \nComputer software displays are included throughout the book. Special Tech \nCenter subsections are available online, and they include instruction for using \nthe software. Each chapter includes a Technology Project. When there are dis-\ncrepancies between answers based on tables and answers based on technology, \nAppendix D provides both answers. The websites www.TriolaStats.com and \nwww.pearsonhighered.com/triola as well as MyStatLab include free text-specific \nsoftware (Statdisk), data sets formatted for several different technologies, and \ninstructional videos for technologies.\n6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning: Assessment tools \ninclude an abundance of section exercises, Chapter Quick Quizzes, Review \nExercises, Cumulative Review Exercises, Technology Projects, From Data to \nDecision projects, and Cooperative Group Activities.\n","page_start":13,"page_end":13,"token_count":556,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":12}

The graphs in Figure 1-1 visually depict the survey results. One of the most impor-\ntant objectives of this book is to encourage the use of critical thinking so that such results are \nnot blindly accepted. We might question whether the survey results are valid. Who conducted \nthe survey? How were respondents selected? Do the graphs in Figure 1-1 depict the results \nwell, or are those graphs somehow misleading?\nThe survey results presented here have major flaws that are among the most common, so \nthey are especially important to recognize. Here are brief descriptions of each of the major flaws:\nFlaw 1: Misleading Graphs The bar chart in Figure 1-1(a) is very deceptive. By using a \nvertical scale that does not start at zero, the difference between the two percentages is grossly \nexaggerated. Figure 1-1(a) makes it appear that approximately eight times as many people \nneed the caffeine. However, with 74% needing caffeine and 26% not needing caffeine, the \nratio is actually about 3:1, rather than the 8:1 ratio that is suggested by the graph.\nThe illustration in Figure 1-1(b) is also deceptive. Again, the difference between the actual \nresponse rates of 74% (needing caffeine) and 26% (not needing caffeine) is a difference that \nis grossly distorted. The picture graph (or “pictograph”) in Figure 1-1(b) makes it appear that \n2 \nCHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistics\nFIGURE 1-1(a) Survey Results\nFIGURE 1-1(b) Survey Results\nPeople Needing Caﬀeine to Start\nUp Brain for the Day\nPeople Not Needing Caﬀeine to Start\nUp Brain for the Day\n","page_start":20,"page_end":20,"token_count":399,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":21}

(Objects with area or volume can distort perceptions because \nthey can be drawn to be disproportionately larger or smaller than the data indicate.) Decep-\ntive graphs are discussed in more detail in Section 2-3, but we see here that the illustrations in \nFigure 1-1 grossly exaggerate the number of people needing caffeine.\nFlaw 2: Bad Sampling Method The aforementioned survey responses are from a USA \nToday survey of Internet users. The survey question was posted on a website and Internet \nusers decided whether to respond. This is an example of a voluntary response sample—a \nsample in which respondents themselves decide whether to participate. With a voluntary \nresponse sample, it often happens that those with a strong interest in the topic are more likely \nto participate, so the results are very questionable. For example, people who strongly feel that \nthey cannot function without their morning cup(s) of coffee might be more likely to respond to \nthe caffeine survey than people who are more ambivalent about caffeine or coffee. When using \nsample data to learn something about a population, it is extremely important to obtain sample \ndata that are representative of the population from which the data are drawn. As we proceed \nthrough this chapter and discuss types of data and sampling methods, we should focus on \nthese key concepts:\n• Sample data must be collected in an appropriate way, such as through a process of \nrandom selection.\n• If sample data are not collected in an appropriate way, the data may be so completely \nuseless that no amount of statistical torturing can salvage them.\nIt would be easy to accept the preceding survey results and blindly proceed with calcula-\ntions and statistical analyses, but we would miss the critical two flaws described above. We \ncould then develop conclusions that are fundamentally wrong and misleading. Instead, we \nshould develop skills in statistical thinking and critical thinking so that we are better prepared \nto analyze such data.\nChapter Objectives \n3\nThe single most important concept presented in this chapter is this: When using meth-\nods of statistics with sample data to form conclusions about a population, it is absolutely \nessential to collect sample data in a way that is appropriate. Here are the main chapter \nobjectives:\nStatistical and Critical Thinking\n• Analyze sample data relative to context, source, and sampling method.\n• Understand the difference between statistical significance and practical significance.\n• Define and identify a voluntary response sample and know that statistical conclu-\nsions based on data from such a sample are generally not valid.\n1-1\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\n>>>\n","page_start":21,"page_end":21,"token_count":551,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":22}

This \nprocess consists of “prepare, analyze, and conclude.” “Preparation” involves consid-\neration of the context, the source of data, and sampling method. In future chapters we \nconstruct suitable graphs, explore the data, and execute computations required for the \nstatistical method being used. In future chapters we also form conclusions by deter-\nmining whether results have statistical significance and practical significance.\nStatistical thinking involves critical thinking and the ability to make sense of results. \nStatistical thinking demands so much more than the ability to execute complicated cal-\nculations. Through numerous examples, exercises, and discussions, this text will help \nyou develop the statistical thinking skills that are so important in today’s world.\nWe begin with some very basic definitions.\n1-1 \nStatistical and Critical Thinking\nDEFINITIONS\nData are collections of observations, such as measurements, or survey responses. \n(A single data value is called a datum, a term rarely used. The term “data” is plural, \nso it is correct to say “data are…” not “data is…”)\nStatistics is the science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data; and \norganizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and \nthen drawing conclusions based on them.\nA population is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are be-\ning considered. Typically, the population is the complete collection of data that we \nwould like to make inferences about.\nA census is the collection of data from every member of the population.\nA sample is a subcollection of members selected from a population.\n","page_start":22,"page_end":22,"token_count":593,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":23}

(The data \nare from Data Set 9 “IQ and Brain Size” in Appendix B.) The data in Table 1-1 consist \nof measured IQ scores and measured brain volumes from 10 different subjects. The \ndata are matched in the sense that each individual “IQ>brain volume” pair of values \nis from the same person. The first subject had a measured IQ score of 96 and a brain \nvolume of 1005 cm3. The format of Table 1-1 suggests the following goal: Determine \nwhether there is a relationship between IQ score and brain volume. This goal suggests \na possible hypothesis: People with larger brains tend to have higher IQ scores.\nSource of the Data The data in Table 1-1 were provided by M. J. Tramo, W. C. \nLoftus, T. A. Stukel, J. B. Weaver, and M. S. Gazziniga, who discuss the data in the \narticle “Brain Size, Head Size, and IQ in Monozygotic Twins,” Neurology, Vol. 50. \nThe researchers are from reputable medical schools and hospitals, and they would not \ngain by presenting the results in way that is misleading. In contrast, Kiwi Brands, a \nmaker of shoe polish, commissioned a study that resulted in this statement, which was \nprinted in some newspapers: “According to a nationwide survey of 250 hiring profes-\nsionals, scuffed shoes was the most common reason for a male job seeker’s failure to \nmake a good first impression.”\nWhen physicians who conduct clinical experiments on the efficacy of drugs re-\nceive funding from drug companies, they have an incentive to obtain favorable results. \nSome professional journals, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, \nnow require that physicians report sources of funding in journal articles. We should be \nskeptical of studies from sources that may be biased.\nSampling Method Figure 1-2 suggests that we conclude our preparation by consid-\nering the sampling method. The data in Table 1-1 were obtained from subjects whose \nmedical histories were reviewed in an effort to ensure that no subjects had neurologic \nor psychiatric disease. In this case, the sampling method appears to be sound, but we \ncannot be sure of that without knowing how the subjects were recruited and whether \nany payments may have affected participation in the study.\nSampling methods and the use of randomization will be discussed in Section 1-3, \nbut for now, we stress that a sound sampling method is absolutely essential for good \nresults in a statistical study. It is generally a bad practice to use voluntary response (or \nself-selected) samples, even though their use is common.\nTABLE 1-1 IQ Scores and Brain Volumes (cm3)\nIQ\n96\n87\n101\n103\n127\n96\n88\n85\n97\n124\nBrain Volume (cm3)\n1005\n1035\n1281\n1051\n1034\n1079\n1104\n1439\n1029\n1160\nDEFINITION\nA voluntary response sample (or self-selected sample) is one in which the \nrespondents themselves decide whether to be included.\nThe following types of polls are common examples of voluntary response samples. \nBy their very nature, all are seriously flawed because we should not make conclusions \nabout a population on the basis of samples with a strong possibility of bias:\n■Internet polls, in which people online can decide whether to respond\n■Mail-in polls, in which people decide whether to reply\nOrigin of “Statistics”\nThe word \nstatistics is \nderived from \nthe Latin word \nstatus (mean-\ning “state”). \nEarly uses of \nstatistics involved compilations \nof data and graphs describing \nvarious aspects of a state or \ncountry.

We should carefully avoid making statements \nnot justified by the statistical analysis. For example, later in this book we introduce \nthe concept of a correlation, or association between two variables, such as smoking \nand pulse rate. A statistical analysis might justify the statement that there is a cor-\nrelation between the number of cigarettes smoked and pulse rate, but it would not \njustify a statement that the number of cigarettes smoked causes a person’s pulse rate \nto change. Such a statement about causality can be justified by physical evidence, not \nby statistical analysis.\nCorrelation does not imply causation.\nSample Data Reported Instead of Measured When collecting data from people, \nit is better to take measurements yourself instead of asking subjects to report results. \nAsk people what they weigh and you are likely to get their desired weights, not their \nactual weights. People tend to round, usually down, sometimes way down. When \nasked, someone with a weight of 187 lb might respond that he or she weighs 160 lb. \nAccurate weights are collected by using a scale to measure weights, not by asking \npeople what they weigh.\nLoaded Questions If survey questions are not worded carefully, the results of a \nstudy can be misleading. Survey questions can be “loaded” or intentionally worded to \nelicit a desired response. Here are the actual rates of “yes” responses for the two dif-\nferent wordings of a question:\n97% yes: “Should the President have the line item veto to eliminate waste?”\n57% yes: “Should the President have the line item veto, or not?”\nOrder of Questions Sometimes survey questions are unintentionally loaded \nby such factors as the order of the items being considered. See the following two \nEXAMPLE 3   Statistical Significance Versus  \nPractical Significance\nProCare Industries once supplied a product named Gender Choice that supposedly \nincreased the chance of a couple having a baby with the gender that they desired. \nIn the absence of any evidence of its effectiveness, the product was banned by the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) as a “gross deception of the consumer.” But \nsuppose that the product was tested with 10,000 couples who wanted to have baby \ngirls, and the results consist of 5200 baby girls born in the 10,000 births. This re-\nsult is statistically significant because the likelihood of it happening due to chance \nis only 0.003%, so chance doesn’t seem like a feasible explanation. That 52% rate \nof girls is statistically significant, but it lacks practical significance because 52% is \nonly slightly above 50%. Couples would not want to spend the time and money to \nincrease the likelihood of a girl from 50% to 52%. (Note: In reality, the likelihood \nof a baby being a girl is about 48.8%, not 50%.)\n","page_start":26,"page_end":26,"token_count":664,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":28}

When people are asked survey questions, some \nfirmly refuse to answer. The refusal rate has been growing in recent years, partly be-\ncause many persistent telemarketers try to sell goods or services by beginning with a \nsales pitch that initially sounds as though it is part of an opinion poll. (This “selling \nunder the guise” of a poll is called sugging.) In Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics, author \nMichael Wheeler makes this very important observation:\nPeople who refuse to talk to pollsters are likely to be different from those \nwho do not. Some may be fearful of strangers and others jealous of their \nprivacy, but their refusal to talk demonstrates that their view of the \nworld around them is markedly different from that of those people who \nwill let poll-takers into their homes.\nPercentages Some studies cite misleading or unclear percentages. Note that 100% \nof some quantity is all of it, but if there are references made to percentages that exceed \n100%, such references are often not justified. If a medical researcher claims that she \nhas developed a treatment for migraine headaches and the treatment results in a 150% \nreduction in those headaches, that researcher cannot be correct, because totally elimi-\nnating all migraine headaches would be a 100% reduction. It is impossible to reduce \nthe number of migraine headaches by more than 100%.\nWhen working with percentages, we should know that % or “percent” really \nmeans “divided by 100.” Here is a principle used often in this book.\nPercentage of: To ﬁnd a percentage of an amount, replace the % symbol with \ndivision by 100, and then interpret “of” to be multiplication.

(Also see Table 1-2 for brief de-\nscriptions of the four levels of measurements.) When we are applying statistics to \nreal problems, the level of measurement of the data helps us decide which procedure \nto use. There will be references to these levels of measurement in this book, but the \nimportant point here is based on common sense: Don’t do computations and don’t use \nstatistical methods that are not appropriate for the data. For example, it would not \nmake sense to compute an average (mean) of Social Security numbers, because those \nnumbers are data used for identification, and they don’t represent measurements or \ncounts of anything.\nGRAMMAR: FEWER VERSUS LESS When describing smaller amounts, it is \ncorrect grammar to use “fewer” for discrete amounts and “less” for continuous \namounts. It is correct to say that we drank fewer cans of cola and that, in the pro-\ncess, we drank less cola. The numbers of cans of cola are discrete data, whereas \nthe volume amounts of cola are continuous data.\nDEFINITION\nThe nominal level of measurement is characterized by data that consist of \nnames, labels, or categories only. It is not possible to arrange the data in some \norder (such as low to high).\nEXAMPLE 4  Nominal Level\nHere are examples of sample data at the nominal level of measurement.\n1. Yes, No, Undecided: Survey responses of yes, no, and undecided\n \n2. Coded Survey Responses: For an item on a survey, respondents are given a \nchoice of possible answers, and they are coded as follows: “I agree” is coded \nas 1; “I disagree” is coded as 2; “I don’t care” is coded as 3; “I refuse to \nanswer” is coded as 4; “Go away and stop bothering me” is coded as 5. The \nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 don’t measure or count anything.\nBecause nominal data lack any ordering or numerical significance, they should \nnot be used for calculations. Numbers such as 1, 2, 3, and 4 are sometimes assigned \nto the different categories (especially when data are coded for computers), but these \nnumbers have no real computational significance and any average (mean) calculated \nfrom them is meaningless and possibly misleading.\nDEFINITION\nData are at the ordinal level of measurement if they can be arranged in some \norder, but differences (obtained by subtraction) between data values either cannot \nbe determined or are meaningless.\n","page_start":34,"page_end":34,"token_count":581,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":37}

These \ngrades can be arranged in order, but we can’t determine differences between the \ngrades. For example, we know that A is higher than B (so there is an ordering), but \nwe cannot subtract B from A (so the difference cannot be found).\nDEFINITION\nData are at the interval level of measurement if they can be arranged in order, and \ndifferences between data values can be found and are meaningful; but data at this \nlevel do not have a natural zero starting point at which none of the quantity is present.\nEXAMPLE 6  Interval Level\nThese examples illustrate the interval level of measurement.\n \n1. Temperatures: Body temperatures of 98.2°F and 98.8°F are examples of data \nat this interval level of measurement. Those values are ordered, and we can \ndetermine their diﬀerence of 0.6°F.

Here are two tools for help with that distinction:\n \n1.  Ratio Test Focus on the term “ratio” and know that the term “twice” describes the \nratio of one value to be double the other value. To distinguish between the interval \nand ratio levels of measurement, use a “ratio test” by asking this question: Does \nuse of the term “twice” make sense? “Twice” makes sense for data at the ratio level \nof measurement, but it does not make sense for data at the interval level of mea-\nsurement.\n \n2.  True Zero For ratios to make sense, there must be a value of “true zero,” where \nthe value of zero indicates that none of the quantity is present, and zero is not \nsimply an arbitrary value on a scale. The temperature of 0°F is arbitrary and \ndoes not indicate that there is no heat, so temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale \nare at the interval level of measurement, not the ratio level.\nEXAMPLE 8   Distinguishing Between the Ratio Level and  \nInterval Level\nFor each of the following, determine whether the data are at the ratio level of mea-\nsurement or the interval level of measurement:\n \na. Times (minutes) it takes to complete a statistics test.\n \nb. Body temperatures (Celsius) of statistics students.\nSOLUTION\n \na. Apply the “ratio test” described in the preceding hint. If one student completes \nthe test in 40 minutes and another student completes the test in 20 min, does it \nmake sense to say that the ﬁrst student used twice as much time? Yes! So the \ntimes are at the ratio level of measurement. Also, a time of 0 minutes does repre-\nsent “no time,” so the value of 0 is a true zero indicating that no time was used.\n \nb.

That is, any \ndata value is just as likely to be missing as any other data value.\n(Note: More complete discussions of missing data will distinguish between missing \ncompletely at random and missing at random, which means that the likelihood of a \nvalue being missing is independent of its value after controlling for another variable. \nThere is no need to know this distinction in this book.)\nExample of Missing Data—Random When using a keyboard to manually enter \nages of survey respondents, the operator is distracted by a colleague singing “Day-\ndream Believer” and makes the mistake of failing to enter the age of 37 years.

Delete Cases: One very common method for dealing with missing data is to \ndelete all subjects having any missing values.\n \n■If the data are missing completely at random, the remaining values are not \nlikely to be biased and good results can be obtained, but with a smaller sam-\nple size.\n \n■If the data are missing not at random, deleting subjects having any missing \nvalues can easily result in a bias among the remaining values, so results can \nbe misleading.\n2.

There are different methods of determining the replacement \nvalues, such as using the mean of the other values, or using a randomly selected \nvalue from other similar cases, or using a method based on regression analysis \n(which will make more sense after studying Chapter 10).\nMeasuring  \nDisobedience\nHow are data \ncollected about \nsomething that \ndoesn’t seem \nto be measur-\nable, such as \npeople’s level of \ndisobedience? \nPsychologist Stanley Milgram \ndevised the following experi-\nment: A researcher instructed a \nvolunteer subject to operate a \ncontrol board that gave increas-\ningly painful “electrical shocks” \nto a third person. Actually, no real \nshocks were given, and the third \nperson was an actor. The volun-\nteer began with 15 volts and was \ninstructed to increase the shocks \nby increments of 15 volts. The \ndisobedience level was the point \nat which the subject refused to \nincrease the voltage. Surpris-\ningly, two-thirds of the subjects \nobeyed orders even when the \nactor screamed and faked a \nheart attack.\n","page_start":39,"page_end":39,"token_count":719,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":"INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS","chunk_index":42}

It would be far better to observe \npast crash results to understand the effects of driving while texting. See the following \ndefinitions.\nEXAMPLE 1  The Salk Vaccine Experiment\nIn 1954, an experiment was designed to test the effectiveness of the Salk vaccine in \npreventing polio, which had killed or paralyzed thousands of children. By random \nselection, 401,974 children were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) 200,745 \nchildren were given a treatment consisting of Salk vaccine injections; (2) 201,229 \nchildren were injected with a placebo that contained no drug. Children were as-\nsigned to the treatment or placebo group through a process of random selection, \nequivalent to flipping a coin. Among the children given the Salk vaccine, 33 later \ndeveloped paralytic polio, and among the children given a placebo, 115 later devel-\noped paralytic polio.\nDEFINITIONS\nIn an experiment, we apply some treatment and then proceed to observe its \n effects on the individuals. (The individuals in experiments are called experimental \nunits, and they are often called subjects when they are people.)\nIn an observational study, we observe and measure specific characteristics, but \nwe don’t attempt to modify the individuals being studied.\nExperiments are often better than observational studies because well-planned experi-\nments typically reduce the chance of having the results affected by some variable that \nis not part of a study. A lurking variable is one that affects the variables included in \nthe study, but it is not included in the study.\nEXAMPLE 2  Ice Cream and Drownings\nObservational Study: Observe past data to conclude that ice cream causes drown-\nings (based on data showing that increases in ice cream sales are associated with \nincreases in drownings). The mistake is to miss the lurking variable of temperature \nand the failure to see that as the temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and \ndrownings increase because more people swim.\nExperiment: Conduct an experiment with one group treated with ice cream while \nanother group gets no ice cream. We would see that the rate of drowning victims \nis about the same in both groups, so ice cream consumption has no effect on \ndrownings.\nHere, the experiment is clearly better than the observational study.\nDesign of Experiments\nGood design of experiments includes replication, blinding, and randomization.\n \n■Replication is the repetition of an experiment on more than one individual. Good \nuse of replication requires sample sizes that are large enough so that we can see \nn \nClinical Trials vs. \nObservational Studies\nIn a New York \nTimes article \nabout hormone \ntherapy for \nwomen, reporter \nDenise Grady \nwrote about \nrandomized \nclinical trials that involve subjects \nwho were randomly assigned to \na treatment group and another \ngroup not given the treatment. \nSuch randomized clinical trials \nare often referred to as the “gold \nstandard” for medical research. \nIn contrast, observational studies \ncan involve patients who decide \nthemselves to undergo some \ntreatment. Subjects who decide \nthemselves to undergo treat-\nments are often healthier than \nother subjects, so the treatment \ngroup might appear to be more \nsuccessful simply because it \ninvolves healthier subjects, not \nnecessarily because the treat-\nment is effective. Researchers \ncriticized observational studies of \nhormone therapy for women by \nsaying that results might appear \nto make the treatment more ef-\nfective than it really is.\n","page_start":43,"page_end":43,"token_count":803,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":"EXPLORING DATA WITH TABLES AND GRAPHS","chunk_index":46}

In the Salk experiment in Example 1, the experiment used \nsufficiently large sample sizes, so the researchers could see that the Salk vaccine \nwas effective.\n \n■Blinding is used when the subject doesn’t know whether he or she is receiving a \ntreatment or a placebo. Blinding is a way to get around the placebo effect, which \noccurs when an untreated subject reports an improvement in symptoms. (The \nreported improvement in the placebo group may be real or imagined.) The Salk \nexperiment in Example 1 was double-blind, which means that blinding occurred \nat two levels: (1) The children being injected didn’t know whether they were \ngetting the Salk vaccine or a placebo, and (2) the doctors who gave the injec-\ntions and evaluated the results did not know either. Codes were used so that the \nresearchers could objectively evaluate the effectiveness of the Salk vaccine.\n \n■Randomization is used when individuals are assigned to different groups \nthrough a process of random selection, as in the Salk vaccine experiment in \nExample 1. The logic behind randomization is to use chance as a way to create \ntwo groups that are similar. The following definition refers to one common and \neffective way to collect sample data in a way that uses randomization.\nDEFINITION\nA simple random sample of n subjects is selected in such a way that every pos-\nsible sample of  the same size n has the same chance of being chosen. (A simple \nrandom sample is often called a random sample, but strictly speaking, a random \nsample has the weaker requirement that all members of the population have the \nsame chance of being selected. That distinction is not so important in this text. \n(See Exercise 38 “Simple Random Sample vs. Random Sample.”)\nThroughout, we will use various statistical procedures, and we often have \na requirement that we have collected a simple random sample, as defined \nabove.\nUnlike careless or haphazard sampling, random sampling usually requires very \ncareful planning and execution.\nOther Sampling Methods In addition to simple random sampling, here are some \nother sampling methods commonly used for surveys. Figure 1-3 illustrates these dif-\nferent sampling methods.\nDEFINITIONS\nIn systematic sampling, we select some starting point and then select every kth \n(such as every 50th) element in the population.\nWith convenience sampling, we simply use data that are very easy to get.\nIn stratified sampling, we subdivide the population into at least two different \nsubgroups (or strata) so that subjects within the same subgroup share the same \ncharacteristics (such as gender). Then we draw a sample from each subgroup (or \nstratum).\nIn cluster sampling, we first divide the population area into sections (or clusters). \nThen we randomly select some of those clusters and choose all the members from \nthose selected clusters.\nHawthorne and \nExperimenter Effects\nThe well-\nknown \nplacebo effect \noccurs when \nan untreated \nsubject incor-\nrectly believes \nthat he or she is receiving a \nreal treatment and reports an \nimprovement in symptoms. The \nHawthorne effect occurs when \ntreated subjects somehow re-\nspond differently, simply because \nthey are part of an experiment. \n(This phenomenon was called \nthe “Hawthorne effect” because \nit was first observed in a study \nof factory workers at Western \nElectric’s Hawthorne plant.) An \nexperimenter effect (sometimes \ncalled a Rosenthal effect) occurs \nwhen the researcher or experi-\nmenter unintentionally influences \nsubjects through such factors as \nfacial expression, tone of voice, \nor attitude.\n","page_start":44,"page_end":44,"token_count":781,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":"EXPLORING DATA WITH TABLES AND GRAPHS","chunk_index":47}

It is impractical to personally survey each household in a simple random \nsample, because they would be scattered all over the country. Instead, the U.S. \n Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics collaborate to conduct a survey \ncalled the Current Population Survey. A recent survey incorporates a multistage \nsample design, roughly following these steps:\n \n1. The entire United States is partitioned into 2,007 diﬀerent regions called \nprimary sampling units (PSUs). The primary sampling units are metropolitan \nareas, large counties, or combinations of smaller counties. The 2,007 primary \nsampling units are then grouped into 824 diﬀerent strata.\nValue of a  \nStatistical Life\nThe value of a \nstatistical life \n(VSL) is a mea-\nsure routinely \ncalculated and \nused for making \ndecisions in \nfields such as \nmedicine, insurance, environ-\nmental health, and transportation \nsafety.

Some people \nlegitimately argue that every life \nis priceless, but others argue that \nthere are conditions in which it \nis impossible or impractical to \nsave every life, so a value must \nbe somehow assigned to a hu-\nman life in order that sound and \nrational decisions can be made. \nNot far from the author’s home, a \nparkway was modified at a cost \nof about $3 million to improve \nsafety at a location where car \noccupants had previously died \nin traffic crashes.

Taking a complete course in the design of experiments \nis a good start in learning so much more about this important topic.\nRandomized Block Design: See Figure 1-5c. A block is a group of subjects that are \nsimilar, but blocks differ in ways that might affect the outcome of the experiment. Use \nthe following procedure, as illustrated in Figure 1-5(c):\n1. Form blocks (or groups) of subjects with similar characteristics.\n2.

By controlling for \ngender, this randomized block design eliminates gender as a possible source of con-\nfounding.\nA randomized block design uses the same basic idea as stratified sampling, but \nrandomized block designs are used when designing experiments, whereas stratified \nsampling is used for surveys.\nMatched Pairs Design: Compare two treatment groups (such as treatment and pla-\ncebo) by using subjects matched in pairs that are somehow related or have similar \ncharacteristics, as in the following cases.\n \n■Before/After: Matched pairs might consist of measurements from subjects before \nand after some treatment, as illustrated in Figure 1-5(d) on the preceding page. \nEach subject yields a “before” measurement and an “after” measurement, and \neach before/after pair of measurements is a matched pair.\n \n■Twins: A test of Crest toothpaste used matched pairs of twins, where one twin \nused Crest and the other used another toothpaste.\nRigorously Controlled Design: Carefully assign subjects to different treatment \ngroups, so that those given each treatment are similar in the ways that are important to \nthe experiment. This can be extremely difficult to implement, and often we can never \nbe sure that we have accounted for all of the relevant factors.\nSampling Errors\nIn statistics, you could use a good sampling method and do everything correctly, and \nyet it is possible to get wrong results. No matter how well you plan and execute the \nsample collection process, there is likely to be some error in the results. The different \ntypes of sampling errors are described here.\nDEFINITIONS\nA sampling error (or random sampling error) occurs when the sample has been \nselected with a random method, but there is a discrepancy between a sample \nresult and the true population result; such an error results from chance sample \nfluctuations.\nA nonsampling error is the result of human error, including such factors as wrong \ndata entries, computing errors, questions with biased wording, false data provided \nby respondents, forming biased conclusions, or applying statistical methods that \nare not appropriate for the circumstances.\nA nonrandom sampling error is the result of using a sampling method that is not \nrandom, such as using a convenience sample or a voluntary response sample.\n","page_start":48,"page_end":48,"token_count":646,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":"EXPLORING DATA WITH TABLES AND GRAPHS","chunk_index":51}

Some statistical procedures, such as those involved with correlation and regression (dis-\ncussed in later chapters) require data that consist of matched pairs of values, and those proce-\ndures ignore pairs in which at least one of the data values in a matched pair is missing. Assume \nthat we want to conduct analyses for correlation and regression on the last two columns of \ndata in Data Set 2: body temperatures measured at 8 AM on day 2 and again at 12 AM on day \n2. For those last two columns, identify the rows with at least one missing value. Note that in \nsome technologies, such as TI-83>84 Plus calculators, missing data must be represented by a \nconstant such as -9 or 999.\nc. Here are two different strategies for reconfiguring the data set to work around the missing \ndata in the last two columns (assuming that we need matched pairs of data with no missing \nvalues):\ni. Manual Deletion Highlight rows with at least one missing value in the last two columns, \nthen delete those rows. This can be tedious if there are many rows with missing data and those \nrows are interspersed throughout instead of being adjacent rows.\nii. Sort Most technologies have a Sort feature that allows you to rearrange all rows using one \nparticular column as the basis for sorting (TI-83>84 Plus calculators do not have this type of sort \nfeature). The result is that all rows remain the same but they are in a different order. First use \nthe technology’s Sort feature to rearrange all rows using the “8 AM day 2” column as the basis \nfor sorting (so that all missing values in the “8 AM day 2” column are at the beginning); then \nhighlight and delete all of those rows with missing values in the “8 AM day 2” column. Next, \nuse the technology’s Sort feature to rearrange all rows using the “12 AM day 2” column as the \nbasis for sorting (so that all missing values in the “12 AM day 2” column are at the beginning); \nthen highlight and delete all of those rows with missing values in the “12 AM day 2” column. \nThe remaining rows will include matched pairs of body temperatures, and those rows will be \nsuitable for analyses such as correlation and regression. Print the resulting reconfigured data set.\n","page_start":56,"page_end":56,"token_count":736,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":"EXPLORING DATA WITH TABLES AND GRAPHS","chunk_index":59}

But do male sym-\nphony conductors really live longer than other groups of \nmales? The Internet can be researched for possible answers. \nLet’s also consider the following.\nAnalysis\n1. Consider the statement that “male symphony conductors \nlive longer.” Identify the specific group that they supposedly \nlive longer than. Does that other group consist of males ran-\ndomly selected from the general population?\n2. It is reasonable to assume that males do not become sym-\nphony conductors until they have reached at least the age \nof 40 years. When comparing life spans of male conduc-\ntors, should we compare them to other males in the general \n population, or should we compare them to other males who \nlived until at least 40 years of age? Explain.\n3. Without any disabilities, males qualify for Medicare if \nthey are 65 or older and meet a few other requirements. If \nwe compare life spans of males on Medicare to life spans \nof males randomly selected from the general population, \nwhy would we find that males on Medicare have longer life \nspans?\n4.

Table 2-2 uses a \nclass width of 20. (The first two lower class boundaries are 50 and 70, and their dif-\nference is 20.)\nCAUTION Finding the correct class width can be tricky.

In this text we use the term “rela-\ntive frequency distribution” whether we use relative frequencies or percentages. Rela-\ntive frequencies and percentages are calculated as follows.\n Relative frequency for a class = frequency for a class\nsum of all frequencies\n Percentage for a class = frequency for a class\nsum of all frequencies * 100%\nTable 2-4 is an example of a relative frequency distribution. It is a variation of \nTable 2-2 in which each class frequency is replaced by the corresponding percent-\nage value. Because there are 78 data values, divide each class frequency by 78, and \nthen multiply by 100%. The first class of Table 2-2 has a frequency of 2, so divide \n2 by 78 to get 0.0256, and then multiply by 100% to get 2.56%, which we rounded \nto 2.6%. The sum of the percentages should be 100%, with a small discrepancy al-\nlowed for rounding errors, so a sum such as 99% or 101% is acceptable. The sum \nof the percentages in Table 2-4 is 100.1%.\nThe sum of the percentages in a relative frequency distribution must be \nvery close to 100%.\nCumulative Frequency Distribution\nAnother variation of a frequency distribution is a cumulative frequency distribu-\ntion in which the frequency for each class is the sum of the frequencies for that class \nand all previous classes. Table 2-5 is a cumulative frequency distribution based on \nTable 2-2. Using the original frequencies of 2, 33, 35, 7, and 1, we add 2 + 33 to get \nthe second cumulative frequency of 35; then we add 2 + 33 + 35 to get the third; \nand so on.

In statistics we are often interested \nin determining whether the data have a normal distribution. (Normal distributions are \ndiscussed extensively in Chapter 6.) Data that have an approximately normal distribu-\ntion are characterized by a frequency distribution with the following features:\nNormal Distribution\n1. The frequencies start low, then increase to one or two high frequencies, and \nthen decrease to a low frequency.\n2. The distribution is approximately symmetric: Frequencies preceding the \nmaximum frequency should be roughly a mirror image of those that follow \nthe maximum frequency.\nTable 2-6 satisfies these two conditions. The frequencies start low, increase to the max-\nimum of 56, and then decrease to a low frequency. Also, the frequencies of 1 and 10 \nthat precede the maximum are a mirror image of the frequencies 10 and 1 that follow \nthe maximum. Real data sets are usually not so perfect as Table 2-6, and judgment \nmust be used to determine whether the distribution comes “close enough” to satisfying \nthe above two conditions. (There are more objective procedures included later.)\nTABLE 2-6 Frequency Distribution Showing a Normal Distribution\nScore\nFrequency\nNormal Distribution\n50–69\n 1\nd Frequencies start low, . . .\n70–89\n10\n 90–109\n56\nd  Increase to a maximum, . . .\n110–129\n10\n130–149\n 1\nd  Decrease to become low again.\nAnalysis of Last Digits Example 3 illustrates this principle:\nFrequencies of last digits sometimes reveal how the data were collected \nor measured.\nEXAMPLE 3   Exploring Data: How Were the Weights Obtained in \nCalifornia? \nWhen collecting weights of people, it’s better to actually weigh people than to \nask them what they weigh.

Ex-\nplore the data by analyzing the histogram to see what can be learned about “CVDOT”: \nthe center of the data, the variation (which will be discussed at length in Section 3-2), \nthe shape of the distribution, whether there are any outliers (values far away from the \nother values), and time (whether there is any change in the characteristics of the data \nover time). Examining Figure 2-2, we see that the histogram is centered close to 90, \nthe values vary from around 50 to 150, and the distribution is roughly bell-shaped. \nThere aren’t any outliers and any changes in time are irrelevant for these data.\nCommon Distribution Shapes\nThe histograms shown in Figure 2-4 depict four common distribution shapes.\nNormal Distribution\nWhen graphed as a histogram, data with a normal distribution have a “bell” shape \nsimilar to the one superimposed in Figure 2-5. Many collections of data have a dis-\ntribution that is approximately normal. Many statistical methods require that sample \ndata come from a population having a distribution that is approximately a normal dis-\ntribution, and we can often use a histogram to judge whether this requirement is satis-\nfied.

For example, redwood trees must compete for light, and numbers of redwood \ntrees in equally sized areas of a region tend to be uniformly distributed.\nSkewness\nA distribution of data is skewed if it is not symmetric and extends more to one side \nthan to the other. Data skewed to the right (also called positively skewed) have a \nlonger right tail, as in Figure 2-4(c). Annual incomes of adult Americans are skewed \nto the right; death rates of nations are skewed to the right. Data skewed to the left \n(also called negatively skewed) have a longer left tail, as in Figure 2-4(d). Life span \ndata in humans are skewed to the left. (Here’s a mnemonic for remembering skew-\nness: A distribution skewed to the right resembles the toes on your right foot, and \none skewed to the left resembles the toes on your left foot.) Distributions skewed to \nthe right are more common than those skewed to the left because it’s often easier to \nget exceptionally large values than values that are exceptionally small. With annual \nincomes, for example, it’s impossible to get values below zero, but there are a few \npeople who earn millions or billions of dollars in a year. Annual incomes therefore \ntend to be skewed to the right.\nPART 2\n  Assessing Normality with  \nNormal Quantile Plots\nSome methods presented in later chapters have a requirement that sample data must \nbe from a population having a normal distribution. Histograms can be helpful in de-\ntermining whether the normality requirement is satisfied, but they are not very help-\nful with small data sets.

Data that are one-\ndimensional in nature (such as budget amounts) are often depicted with two-dimensional \nobjects (such as dollar bills) or three-dimensional objects (such as stacks of coins, \nhomes, or barrels). With pictographs, artists can create false impressions that grossly \ndistort differences by using these simple principles of basic geometry: (1) When you \ndouble each side of a square, its area doesn’t merely double; it increases by a factor \nof four. (2) When you double each side of a cube, its volume doesn’t merely double; \nit increases by a factor of eight.\nBy using a vertical scale that starts at 10% instead of 0%, Figure 2-12(a) \ngrossly exaggerates the difference between the two groups. Figure 2-12(a) makes it \nappear that those using OxyContin experience nausea at a rate that is about 12 times \nhigher than the rate for those using a placebo, but Figure 2-12(b) shows that the true \nratio is about 2:1, not 12:1. Perhaps someone wants to discourage recreational use \nof OxyContin by misleading people into thinking that the problem with nausea is \nmuch greater than it really is. The objective might be sincere, but the use of a mis-\nleading graph is not the way to achieve that objective.\nPICTOGRAPHS: When examining data depicted with a pictograph, determine \nwhether the graph is misleading because objects of area or volume are used to \ndepict amounts that are actually one-dimensional. (Histograms and bar charts \nrepresent one-dimensional data with two-dimensional bars, but they use bars with \nthe same width so that the graph is not misleading.)\nEXAMPLE 9  Pictograph of Cigarette Smokers\nRefer to Figure 2-13 and see that the larger cigarette is about twice as long, twice as \ntall, and twice as deep as the smaller cigarette, so the volume of the larger cigarette \nis about eight times the volume of the smaller cigarette. (The data are from the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention.)

A value of exactly -1 or 1 implies that all of the data fall exactly on a line, which \nreflects a perfect correlation. If r is close to -1 or close to 1, there appears to be a \nstrong correlation, but if r is close to 0, there appears to be a weak or no linear cor-\nrelation. For the data depicted in the scatterplot of Figure 2-14, r = 0.802 (somewhat \nclose to 1), and the data in the scatterplot of Figure 2-15 result in r = 0.082 (pretty \nclose to 0). These descriptions of “close to” -1 or 1 or 0 are vague, but there are other \nobjective criteria discussed in Chapter 10. See the following example illustrating the \ninterpretation of the linear correlation coefficient r.\nTABLE 2-10 Shoe Print Lengths and Heights of Males\nShoe Print Length (cm)\n29.7\n29.7\n31.4\n31.8\n27.6\nHeight (cm)\n175.3\n177.8\n185.4\n175.3\n172.7\nEXAMPLE 3   Correlation Between Shoe Print  \nLengths and Heights?\nConsider the data in Table 2-10 (using data from Data Set 7 “Foot and Height” in \nAppendix B).

Although this \nchapter includes detailed steps for important procedures, it isn’t always necessary to \nmaster those steps. It is, however, generally helpful to perform a few manual calcula-\ntions before using technology, so that understanding is enhanced.\nThe methods and tools presented in this chapter are often called methods of \ndescriptive statistics, because they summarize or describe relevant characteristics of \ndata. In later chapters we use inferential statistics to make inferences, or generaliza-\ntions, about populations. Here are the chapter objectives:\nMeasures of Center\n• Develop the ability to measure the center of data by finding the mean, median, \nmode, and midrange.\n• Determine whether an outlier has a substantial effect on the mean and median.\nMeasures of Variation\n• Develop the ability to measure variation in a set of sample data by finding values of \nthe range, variance, and standard deviation.\n3-1\n3-2\nFIGURE 3-1 Dotplot of Pulse Rates of Males and Females\n76 \nCHAPTER 3 Describing, Exploring, and Comparing Data\n","page_start":94,"page_end":94,"token_count":451,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":"DESCRIBING, EXPLORING, AND COMPARING DATA","chunk_index":98}

The following definition is more precise.\nCAUTION Never use the term average when referring to a measure of center. \nThe word average is often used for the mean, but it is sometimes used for other \nmeasures of center. The term average is not used by statisticians, it is not used in \nprofessional journals, and it will not be used throughout the remainder of this book \nwhen referring to a specific measure of center.\nDEFINITION\nThe median of a data set is the measure of center that is the middle value when the \noriginal data values are arranged in order of increasing (or decreasing) magnitude.\nImportant Properties of the Median\n \n■The median does not change by large amounts when we include just a few ex-\ntreme values, so the median is a resistant measure of center.\n \n■The median does not directly use every data value. (For example, if the largest \nvalue is changed to a much larger value, the median does not change.)\nCalculation and Notation of the Median\nThe median of a sample is sometimes denoted by x∼ (pronounced “x-tilde”) or M or \nMed; there isn’t a commonly accepted notation and there isn’t a special symbol for \nthe median of a population. To find the median, first sort the values (arrange them in \norder), and then follow one of these two procedures:\n1. If the number of data values is odd, the median is the number located in the ex-\nact middle of the sorted list.\n2. If the number of data values is even, the median is found by computing the \nmean of the two middle numbers in the sorted list.\nEXAMPLE 2  Median with an Odd Number of Data Values\nFind the median of the first five pulse rates for males: 84, 74, 50, 60, 52 (all in \nBPM).\nSOLUTION\nFirst sort the data values by arranging them in ascending order, as shown below:\n50 52 60 74 84\nBecause there are 5 data values, the number of data values is an odd number (5), \nso the median is the number located in the exact middle of the sorted list, which is \n60.0 BPM. The median is therefore 60.0 BPM. Note that the median of 60.0 BPM \nis different from the mean of 64.0 BPM found in Example 1.\nWhat the Median Is Not\nHarvard  \nbiologist Ste-\nphen Jay Gould \nwrote, “The \nMedian Isn’t the \nMessage.” In \nit, he describes \nhow he learned that he had ab-\ndominal mesothelioma, a form of \ncancer. He went to the library to \nlearn more, and he was shocked \nto find that mesothelioma was \nincurable, with a median survival \ntime of only eight months after \nit was discovered. Gould wrote \nthis: “I suspect that most people, \nwithout training in statistics, \nwould read such a statement as \n‘I will probably be dead in eight \nmonths’ the very conclusion that \nmust be avoided, since it isn’t \nso, and since attitude (in fighting \nthe cancer) matters so much.” \nGould went on to carefully \ninterpret the value of the median. \nHe knew that his chance of liv-\ning longer than the median was \ngood because he was young, his \ncancer was diagnosed early, and \nhe would get the best medical \ntreatment. He also reasoned that \nsome could live much longer \nthan eight months, and he saw \nno reason why he could not be \nin that group. Armed with this \nthoughtful interpretation of the \nmedian and a strong positive \nattitude, Gould lived for 20 years \nafter his diagnosis. He died of \nanother cancer not related to the \nmesothelioma.\n","page_start":97,"page_end":97,"token_count":856,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":"DESCRIBING, EXPLORING, AND COMPARING DATA","chunk_index":101}

In Section 1-2 we noted that it \nmakes no sense to do numerical calculations with data at the nominal level of mea-\nsurement, because those data consist of names, labels, or categories only, so statistics \nsuch as the mean and median are meaningless for such data.

If the sampling method is not \nsound, the statistics we obtain may be very misleading.\nEXAMPLE 6  Critical Thinking and Measures of Center\nEach of the following illustrates data for which the mean and median are not mean-\ningful statistics.\na.

(The \nnumbers on the football jerseys don’t measure or count anything; they are just \nsubstitutes for names.)\n \nd. Top 5 incomes of hospital chief executive oﬃcers. (Such “top 5” or “top 10” \nlists include data that are not at all representative of the larger population.)\n \ne. The 50 mean ages computed from the means in each of the 50 states. (If you \ncalculate the mean of those 50 values, the result is not the mean age of people \nin the entire United States. The population sizes of the 50 diﬀerent states must \nbe taken into account, as described in the weighted mean introduced in Part 2 \nof this section.)\nIn the spirit of describing, exploring, and comparing data, we provide Table 3-1, \nwhich summarizes the different measures of center for the 300 pulse rates referenced \nin the Chapter Problem. Figure 3-1 on page 76 suggests that males have lower pulse \nrates, and comparison of the means and medians in Table 3-1 also suggests that males \nhave lower pulse rates.

The range is not resistant.\n \n■Because the range uses only the maximum and minimum values, it does not take \nevery value into account and therefore does not truly reflect the variation among \nall of the data values.\nEXAMPLE 1  Range\nFind the range of the first five pulse rates for males from Data Set 1 “Body Data” in \nAppendix B: 84, 74, 50, 60, 52 (all in BPM).\nSOLUTION\nThe range is found by subtracting the lowest value from the largest value, so we get\nRange = 1maximum value2 - 1minimum value2 = 84 - 50 = 34.0 BPM\nThe range of 34.0 BPM is shown with one more decimal place than is present in the \noriginal data values.\nStandard Deviation of a Sample\nThe standard deviation is the measure of variation most commonly used in statistics.\nDEFINITION\nThe standard deviation of a set of sample values, denoted by s, is a measure  \nof how much data values deviate away from the mean. It is calculated by using  \nFormula 3-4 or 3-5. Formula 3-5 is just a different version of Formula 3-4; both for-\nmulas are algebraically the same.\nThe standard deviation found from sample data is a statistic denoted by s, but the stan-\ndard deviation found from population data is a parameter denoted by s. The formula \nfor s is slightly different with division by the population size N used instead of divi-\nsion by n - 1. The population standard deviation s will be discussed later.\nNotation\ns = sample standard deviation\ns = population standard deviation\nR\nL\np\nGot a Second?\nThe time unit \nof 1 second \nis defined \nto be “the \nduration of \n9,192,631,770 \nperiods of the \nradiation corresponding to the \ntransition between the two hy-\nperfine levels of the ground state \nof the cesium-133 atom.” That \ndefinition redefines time to be \nbased on the behavior of atoms \ninstead of the earth’s motion. It \nresults in accuracy of ±1 second \nin 10,000,000 years, which is the \nmost accurate measurement we \nuse. Because it is so accurate, the \nsecond is being used to define \nother quantities, such as the me-\nter. The meter was once defined \nas 1>10,000,000 of the distance \nalong the surface of the earth \nbetween the North Pole and the \nequator (passing through Paris). \nThe meter is now defined as the \nlength of the distance traveled by \nlight in a vacuum during a time \ninterval of 1>299,792,458 sec.\nWhen dealing with time mea-\nsurement devices, the traditional \nstandard deviation has been \nfound to be poor because of a \ntrend in which the mean changes \nover time. Instead, other special \nmeasures of variation are used, \nsuch as Allan variance, total vari-\nance, and TheoH.\nUnrelated to statistics but \nnonetheless interesting is the \nfact that ads for watches usually \nshow a watch with a time close \nto 10:10.

It is zero only when all of the data \nvalues are the same number.\n \n■The sample variance s2 is an unbiased estimator of the population variance s2, \nas described in Part 2 of this section. (The sample standard deviation s is a biased \nestimator of the population standard deviation s.)\nThe variance is a statistic used in some statistical methods, but for our present pur-\nposes, the variance has the serious disadvantage of using units that are different than \nthe units of the original data set. This makes it difficult to understand variance as it \nrelates to the original data set. Because of this property, it is better to first focus on the \nstandard deviation when trying to develop an understanding of variation.\nPART 2\nBeyond the Basics of Variation\nIn Part 2, we focus on making sense of the standard deviation so that it is not some \nmysterious number devoid of any practical significance. We begin by addressing com-\nmon questions that relate to the standard deviation.\nWhy Is Standard Deviation Defined as in Formula 3-4?\nIn measuring variation in a set of sample data, it makes sense to begin with the indi-\nvidual amounts by which values deviate from the mean. For a particular data value x, \nthe amount of deviation is x - x. It makes sense to somehow combine those devia-\ntions into one number that can serve as a measure of the variation. Adding the devia-\ntions isn’t good, because the sum will always be zero. To get a statistic that measures \nvariation, it’s necessary to avoid the canceling out of negative and positive numbers. \nOne approach is to add absolute values, as in Σ\u001ax - x \u001a. If we find the mean of that \nsum, we get the mean absolute deviation (or MAD), which is the mean distance of \nthe data from the mean:\nMean absolute deviation = Σ\u001ax - x \u001a\nn\nWhy Not Use the Mean Absolute Deviation Instead of the Standard \nDeviation?

The use of absolute values would be simple, but it would create \nalgebraic difficulties in inferential methods of statistics discussed in later chap-\nters. The standard deviation has the advantage of using only algebraic opera-\ntions. Because it is based on the square root of a sum of squares, the standard \ndeviation closely parallels distance formulas found in algebra. There are many \ninstances where a statistical procedure is based on a similar sum of squares. \nConsequently, instead of using absolute values, we square all deviations 1x - x2\nso that they are nonnegative, and those squares are used to calculate the standard \ndeviation.\nWhy Divide by n −1? After finding all of the individual values of 1x - x2 2 we \ncombine them by finding their sum. We then divide by n - 1 because there are only \nn - 1 values that can assigned without constraint. With a given mean, we can use any \nnumbers for the first n - 1 values, but the last value will then be automatically deter-\nmined. With division by n - 1, sample variances s2 tend to center around the value of \nthe population variance s2; with division by n, sample variances s2 tend to underesti-\nmate the value of the population variance s2.\nComparing Variation in Different Samples or Populations\nIt’s a good practice to compare two sample standard deviations only when the sample \nmeans are approximately the same. When comparing variation in samples or popula-\ntions with very different means, it is better to use the coefficient of variation. Also use \nthe coefficient of variation to compare variation from two samples or populations with \ndifferent scales or units of values, such as the comparison of variation of pulse rates of \nmen and heights of men. (See Example 6.)\nDEFINITION\nThe coefficient of variation (or CV) for a set of nonnegative sample or popula-\ntion data, expressed as a percent, describes the standard deviation relative to the \nmean, and is given by the following:\n \nSample \nPopulation\n \nCV = s\nx # 100% \nCV = s\nm # 100%\nROUND-OFF RULE FOR THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION Round the \ncoefficient of variation to one decimal place (such as 25.3%).\nEXAMPLE 6  Pulse Rates and Heights\nCompare the variation of the 153 male pulse rates listed in Data Set 1 “Body \nData” in Appendix B and the heights of the same males. For the male pulse \nrates, x = 69.6 BPM and s = 11.3 BPM; for their heights, x = 174.12 cm and \ns = 7.10 cm.

While individual \nvalues of s could equal or exceed s, values of s generally tend to underestimate the \nvalue of s. For example, consider an IQ test designed so that the population standard \ndeviation is 15. If you repeat the process of randomly selecting 100 subjects, giving \nthem IQ tests, and calculating the sample standard deviation s in each case, the sample \nstandard deviations that you get will tend to be less than 15, which is the population \nstandard deviation.

Percentiles and quartiles \nare other measures of position useful for comparing values within the same data set or \nbetween different sets of data.\nPercentiles\nPercentiles are one type of quantiles—or fractiles—which partition data into groups \nwith roughly the same number of values in each group.\nEXAMPLE 2  Is a Platelet Count of 75 Significantly Low?\nThe lowest platelet count in Data Set 1 “Body Data” in Appendix B is 75. (The \nplatelet counts are measured in 1000 cells>mL). Is that value significantly low? \nBased on the platelet counts from Data Set 1 in Appendix B, assume that platelet \ncounts have a mean of x = 239.4 and a standard deviation of s = 64.2.\nSOLUTION\nThe platelet count of 75 is converted to a z score as shown below:\nz = x - x\ns\n= 75 - 239.4\n64.2\n= -2.56\nINTERPRETATION\nThe platelet count of 75 converts to the z score of -2.56. Refer to Figure 3-4 to \nsee that z = -2.56 is less than -2, so the platelet count of 75 is significantly low. \n(Low platelet counts are called thrombocytopenia. What a wonderful name.)\nDEFINITION\nPercentiles are measures of location, denoted P1, P2, . . . , P99, which divide a set of \ndata into 100 groups with about 1% of the values in each group.\nThe 50th percentile, denoted P50, has about 50% of the data values below it and about \n50% of the data values above it, so the 50th percentile is the same as the median. \nThere is not universal agreement on a single procedure for calculating percentiles, but \nwe will describe relatively simple procedures for (1) finding the percentile of a data \nvalue and (2) converting a percentile to its corresponding data value. We begin with \nthe first procedure.\nFinding the Percentile of a Data Value\nThe process of finding the percentile that corresponds to a particular data value x \nis given by the following (round the result to the nearest whole number):\nPercentile of value x = number of values less than x\ntotal number of values\n# 100\nDetecting Phony Data\nA class is \ngiven the \nhomework \nassignment of \nrecording the \nresults when a \ncoin is tossed \n500 times. One dishonest stu-\ndent decides to save time by just \nmaking up the results instead of \nactually flipping a coin. Because \npeople generally cannot make \nup results that are really random, \nwe can often identify such phony \ndata. With 500 tosses of an ac-\ntual coin, it is extremely likely that \nyou will get a run of six heads or \nsix tails, but people almost never \ninclude such a run when they \nmake up results.\nAnother way to detect fab-\nricated data is to establish that \nthe results violate Benford’s law: \nFor many collections of data, the \nleading digits are not uniformly \ndistributed. Instead, the leading \ndigits of 1, 2,…, 9 occur with \nrates of 30%, 18%, 12%, 10%, \n8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, and 5%, re-\nspectively.

In Chapter 2 we described outliers as sample values that lie very far away from \nthe vast majority of the other values in a set of data, but that description is vague and \nit does not provide specific objective criteria.

The five-number summary is 40, 62.0, 68.0, 76.0, 104 (all \nin BPM).\nSOLUTION\nLet’s begin with the four steps for identifying outliers in a modified boxplot.\n1. Using the pulse rates of males, the three quartiles are Q1 = 62.0, the median \nis Q2 = 68.0, and Q3 = 76.0.\n2. The interquartile range is IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 76.0 - 62.0 = 14.0.\n3. 1.5 * IQR = 1.5 * 14.0 = 21.0.\n \n4. Any outliers are\n \n■Greater than Q3 = 76.0 by more than 21.0 or\n \n■Less than Q1 = 62.0 by more than 21.0.\nThis means that any outliers are greater than 97.0 or less than 41.0. We can now \nexamine the original pulse rates of males to identify any that are greater than 97.0 or \nless than 41.0. We find that the pulse rates of 102 and 104 are greater than 97.0, and \nthe pulse rate of 40 is less than 41.0. The outliers are 102, 104, and 40.\nWe can now construct the modified boxplot shown in Figure 3-8. In Figure 3-8, \nthe three outliers (40, 102, 104) are identified as special points, the three quartiles \n(62.0, 68.0, 76.0) are shown as in a regular boxplot, and the horizontal line extends \nfrom the lowest data value that is not an outlier (42) to the highest data value that is \nnot an outlier (96).\nFIGURE 3-8 Modified Boxplot of Male Pulse Rates (BPM)\nCAUTION Because there is not universal agreement on procedures for finding \nquartiles, and because modified boxplots are based on quartiles, different \ntechnologies may yield different modified boxplots.\n","page_start":129,"page_end":129,"token_count":608,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":"PROBABILITY","chunk_index":138}

Even though there is a chance of getting 75 girls (or \nmore) in 100 births with no special treatment, the probability of that happening is so \nsmall (0.0000003) that we should reject chance as a reasonable explanation.

A simu-\nlation of a procedure is a process that behaves in the same ways as the procedure itself \nso that similar results are produced. Probabilities can sometimes be found by using a \nsimulation. See the Technology Project near the end of this chapter.\nRounding Probabilities Although it is difficult to develop a universal rule for round-\ning off probabilities, the following guide will apply to most problems in this text.\nROUNDING PROBABILITIES\nWhen expressing the value of a probability, either give the exact fraction or deci-\nmal or round off final decimal results to three significant digits. (Suggestion: When \na probability is not a simple fraction such as 2>3 or 5>9, express it as a decimal so \nthat the number can be better understood.) All digits in a number are significant ex-\ncept for the zeros that are included for proper placement of the decimal point. See \nthe following examples.\n \n■The probability of 0.4450323339 (from Example 6) has ten significant digits \n(4450323339), and it can be rounded to three significant digits as 0.445.\n \n■The probability of 1>3 can be left as a fraction or rounded to 0.333. (Do not \nround to 0.3.)\n \n■The probability of 2>8 can be expressed as 1>4 or 0.25. (Because 0.25 is exact, \nthere’s no need to express it with three significant digits as 0.250.)\nProbabilities Expressed as Percentages? Mathematically, a probability of 0.25 is \nequivalent to 25%, but there are good reasons for sticking with fractions and decimals \nand not using percentages. Professional journals almost universally express probabili-\nties as decimals, not as percentages. Later in this book, we will use probability values \ngenerated from statistical software, and they will always be in the form of decimals.\nWhen finding probabilities with the relative frequency approach, we obtain an ap-\nproximation instead of an exact value. As the total number of observations increases, \nthe corresponding approximations tend to get closer to the actual probability. This \nproperty is commonly referred to as the law of large numbers.\nLAW OF LARGE NUMBERS\nAs a procedure is repeated again and again, the relative frequency probability of \nan event tends to approach the actual probability.\nThe law of large numbers tells us that relative frequency approximations tend to get \nbetter with more observations. This law reflects a simple notion supported by common \nsense: A probability estimate based on only a few trials can be off by a substantial amount, \nbut with a very large number of trials, the estimate tends to be much more accurate.\nCAUTIONS\n1.  The law of large numbers applies to behavior over a large number of trials, and it \ndoes not apply to any one individual outcome. Gamblers sometimes foolishly lose \nlarge sums of money by incorrectly thinking that a string of losses increases the \nchances of a win on the next bet, or that a string of wins is likely to continue.\n2.  If we know nothing about the likelihood of different possible outcomes, we \nshould not assume that they are equally likely.

If the outcome of \nevent A somehow affects the probability of event B, it is important to adjust the prob-\nability of B to reflect the occurrence of event A. The rule for finding P(A and B) is \ncalled the multiplication rule because it involves the multiplication of the probability \nof event A and the probability of event B (where, if necessary, the probability of event \nB is adjusted because of the outcome of event A).

This \napproach is reflected in the above formal addition rule.\nEXAMPLE 1  Drug Testing of Job Applicants\nRefer to Table 4-1, reproduced here for your convenience and viewing pleasure. \nIf 1 subject is randomly selected from the 555 subjects given a drug test, find the \nprobability of selecting a subject who had a positive test result or uses drugs.\nw\nev\nab\nProportions of  \nMales, Females\nIt is well \nknown that \nwhen a baby is \nborn, boys and \ngirls are not \nequally likely.

True or false: A pound of feathers is heavier than a pound of gold.\n2. Who said, “By a small sample, we may judge of the whole piece”?  \n(a) Judge Judy; (b) Judge Dredd; (c) Miguel de Cervantes; (d) George \nGallup; (e) Gandhi\nThe answers are T (true) and c. (The first answer is true, because weights of feath-\ners are in avoirdupois units where a pound is 453.59 g, but weights of gold and other \nprecious metals are in troy units where a pound is 373.24 g. The second answer is \nfrom Don Quixote by Cervantes.)\nHere is the sample space for the different possible answers:\nTa Tb Tc Td Te Fa Fb Fc Fd Fe\nIf both answers are random guesses, then the above 10 possible outcomes are equally \nlikely, so\nP1both correct2 = P1T and c2 = 1\n10 = 0.1\nWith P1T and c2 = 1>10, P1T2 = 1>2, and P1c2 = 1>5, we see that\n1\n10 = 1\n2 # 1\n5\nA tree diagram is a graph of the possible outcomes of a procedure, as in Figure 4-4. \nFigure 4-4 shows that if both answers are random guesses, all 10 branches are equally \nlikely and the probability of getting the correct pair (T, c) is 1>10.

The probability of all three hydraulic systems \nfailing is 0.002 #  0.002 #  0.002 = 0.000000008.

That is, P(positive test result given that cancer is \npresent) = 0.80.\nFind P1C\u001fpositive test result2.

We can find the entries in Table 4-2 on the next page, as follows.\n■Assume that we have 1000 subjects. With a 1% prevalence rate, 10 of the sub-\njects are expected to have cancer. The sum of the entries in the first row of val-\nues is therefore 10.\n■The other 990 subjects do not have cancer. The sum of the entries in the second \nrow of values is therefore 990.\n■Among the 990 subjects without cancer, 10% get positive test results, so 10% \nof the 990 cancer-free subjects in the second row get positive test results.

This \nsection also introduces “number needed to treat” as a measure of the number of sub-\njects that must be treated in order to prevent the single occurrence of some event, such \nas a disease.\nOne simple way to measure risk is to use a probability value. For example, in one \nof the largest medical experiments ever conducted, it was found that among 200,745 \nchildren injected with the Salk vaccine, 33 developed paralytic polio (poliomyelitis). \nIt follows that for this treatment group, P1polio2 = 33>200,745 = 0.000164.

The risk of polio for children treated \nwith the Salk vaccine should be somehow compared to the risk of polio for those chil-\ndren given a placebo.

That is, there are 0.0407% \nfewer events of polio for subjects treated with the Salk vaccine than for subjects given \na placebo. This doesn’t seem like much of a reduction, but when considered in the con-\ntext of the number of polio events in a large population, it is a significant reduction.\nRelative Risk\nSection 1-3 included definitions of retrospective and prospective studies:\n \n■Retrospective Study: Data are collected from a past time period by going back in \ntime (through examinations of records, interviews, etc.).\n \n■Prospective Study: Data are collected in the future from groups or “cohorts” that \nshare common factors.\nA\nMonkey Typists\nA classical \nclaim is that \na monkey \nrandomly \nhitting a key-\nboard would \neventually \nproduce the complete works of \nShakespeare, assuming that it \ncontinues to type century after \ncentury.

However, Table 4-7 \nbelow is based on a retrospective study in which the researcher went back in time to \nfind 985 subjects with lung cancer and 985 subjects without lung cancer, so Table 4-7 \ndoes not reflect actual incidence rates. See the following.\nFrom Table 4-6: P1lung cancer \u001esmoker2 = 13>180 = 0.0722\nFrom Table 4-7: P1lung cancer \u001esmoker2 = 854>1021 = 0.836\nThe above probabilities are very different, so both of them cannot be good estimates of \nthe likelihood of getting lung cancer from smoking. The above probability of 0.0722 \nis a good estimate because it is based on a prospective study with realistic incidence \nrates, but the probability of 0.836 is a poor estimate because it is based on the retro-\nspective study designed to include an equal number of subjects with lung cancer and \nsubjects without lung cancer.\nNow compare the relative risk values and the odds ratio values from Tables 4-6 \nand 4-7. See that the odds ratio values are approximately the same, but the relative risk \nvalues are dramatically different. The relative risk value of 29.6 from the prospective \nstudy is a good measure, but the relative risk of 6.1 from the retrospective study is a \npoor measure.\nIf we take advantage of the fact that Table 4-5 does correspond to the generalized \nTable 4-4 on page 153, then the odds ratio can also be calculated as follows:\nOdds ratio = ad\nbc = 14572128602\n13199212602 = 1.571\nINTERPRETATION\nThis result indicates that the odds in favor of rehospitalization are 1.571 times \nhigher for babies discharged early when compared to those discharged late. This \nsuggests that newborns discharged early are at substantially increased risk of rehos-\npitalization.\nTABLE 4-6 Prospective Study\nRR = 29.6; OR = 31.8\nLung Cancer\nNo Lung Cancer\nSmoker\n13\n167\nNonsmoker\n 2\n818\nTABLE 4-7 Retrospective Study\nRR = 6.1; OR = 31.9\nLung Cancer\nNo Lung Cancer\nSmoker\n854\n167\nNonsmoker\n131\n818\nTotal\n985\n985\n","page_start":177,"page_end":177,"token_count":710,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":"PROBABILITY","chunk_index":190}

When compar-\ning two different regions, such as Florida and Colorado, a comparison of rates can be \nmisleading because of differences in factors such as age that might affect the rates. In \na recent year, the crude mortality rates (per 1000 population) were 9.1 in Florida and \n6.4 in Colorado. This is not too surprising, considering that in Florida, roughly 18% of \nthe population is over the age of 65, compared to only 11% for Colorado. The higher \nmortality rate for Florida does not mean that Florida is less healthy; in this case, it \nappears that Florida has a higher death rate largely because it has a higher proportion \nof older residents. Instead of using crude rates, we might use either specific rates or \nadjusted rates.\nSpecific rates are rates specific for some particular group, such as people aged \n18–24, or rates specific for some particular cause of death, such as deaths due to myo-\ncardial infarction.\nAdjusted rates involve calculations that can be quite complicated, but they basi-\ncally make adjustments for important factors, such as age, gender, or race.\nBecause age is the characteristic that typically affects mortality the most, it is the \nmost common factor used as the basis for adjustment. Calculations of adjusted rates \ninvolve the creation of a theoretical standardized population that is used for the re-\ngions being compared. A population of 1,000,000 people with the same composition \nas the United States is often used as the standardized population. Adjusted rates are \nvaluable for comparing different regions, but they do not necessarily reflect the true \ncrude death rates. Adjusted rates should not be used as death rates and they should not \nbe compared to crude rates.\nWhen assessing the accuracy of rates, we should consider the source. Mortality \nrates found in a source such as the Statistical Abstract of the United States (compiled \nby the U.S. Bureau of the Census) are likely to be quite accurate, because each state \nnow has a mandatory death reporting system, although official government reports \nseem to take years to produce. However, morbidity rates are likely to be less accurate, \nbecause some diseases are known to be underreported or not reported at all. Some \nmorbidity rates might be the result of very questionable surveys. However, some sur-\nveys, such as the annual National Health Survey, involve large samples of people who \nare very carefully chosen, so that results are likely to be very accurate.\nStatistical Literacy and Critical Thinking \n1. Birth Rate The birth rate in China is 12.3 per 1000.

Use of the factorial rule has the advantage of including the \nfactorial symbol, which is sure to impress.\nDEFINITIONS\nPermutations of items are arrangements in which different sequences of the same \nitems are counted separately.

(The letter arrangements of abc, acb, \nbac, bca, cab, and cba are all considered to be the same single combination.)\nMnemonics for Permutations and Combinations\n \n■Remember “Permutations Position,” where the alliteration reminds us that with \npermutations, the positions of the items makes a difference.\n \n■Remember “Combinations Committee,” which reminds us that with members of \na committee, rearrangements of the same members result in the same committee, \nso order does not count.\n3. Permutations Rule (When All of the Items Are Different)\nThe permutations rule is used when there are n different items available for selection, \nwe must select r of them without replacement, and the sequence of the items matters. \nThe result is the total number of arrangements (or permutations) that are possible. (Re-\nmember: Rearrangements of the same items are counted as different permutations.)\nPERMUTATIONS RULE: When n different items are available and r of them are \nselected without replacement, the number of different permutations (order counts) \nis given by\nnPr =\nn!\n1n - r2!\n","page_start":186,"page_end":186,"token_count":558,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":5,"chapter_title":"DISCRETE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","chunk_index":199}

To be very cautious, we plan to treat the 5 subjects in \nsequence, so that any particularly adverse effect can allow us to stop the treatments \nbefore any other subjects are treated.

These couples \nmay want to use gender selection as a way to ensure that they \nhave baby girls, thereby guaranteeing that a disorder will not \nbe inherited by any of their children.\nThe Genetics & IVF Institute in Fairfax, Virginia, devel-\noped a technique called MicroSort and claimed that it in-\ncreases the chances of a couple having a baby with a desired \ngender. (Clinical trials of MicroSort have been discontinued.) \nThe  MicroSort XSORT method is claimed to increase the \nchances of a couple having a baby girl, and the MicroSort \nYSORT method is claimed to increase the chances of a \nbaby boy. The latest results for the XSORT method consist \nof 945 couples who wanted to have baby girls. After using \nthe XSORT technique, 879 of those couples had baby girls. \n(See Figure 5-1 for a bar graph illustrating these results.) \nWe usually expect that in 945 births, the number of girls \nshould be somewhere around 472 or 473. Given that 879 out \nof 945 couples had girls, can we conclude that the XSORT \ntechnique is effective, or might we explain the outcome as \njust a chance sample result? In answering that question, we \nwill use principles of probability to determine whether the \nobserved birth  results differ significantly from results that we \nwould expect from random chance.

Then we could summarize the results in a table representing a probability \ndistribution.\nIn this chapter we merge the above two approaches as we create a table de-\nscribing what we expect to happen (instead of what did happen), then we find the \npopulation mean m and population standard deviation s. The table at the extreme \nright in Figure 5-2 is a probability distribution, because it describes the distribution \nusing probabilities instead of frequency counts.

It is often expressed in the format of a table, formula, or \ngraph.\nIn Section 1-2 we made a distinction between discrete and continuous data. \n Random variables may also be discrete or continuous, and the following two defini-\ntions are consistent with those given in Section 1-2.\nDEFINITIONS\nA discrete random variable has a collection of values that is finite or countable. \n(If there are infinitely many values, the number of values is countable if it is pos-\nsible to count them individually, such as the number of tosses of a coin before \ngetting heads.)\nA continuous random variable has infinitely many values, and the collec-\ntion of values is not countable. (That is, it is impossible to count the individual \nitems because at least some of them are on a continuous scale, such as body \ntemperatures.)\nThis chapter deals exclusively with discrete random variables, but the following \nchapters deal with continuous random variables.\nProbability Distribution: Requirements\nEvery probability distribution must satisfy each of the following three requirements.\n1. There is a numerical (not categorical) random variable x, and its number values \nare associated with corresponding probabilities.\n2. ΣP(x)  =   1 where x assumes all possible values. (The sum of all probabilities \nmust be 1, but sums such as 0.999 or 1.001 are acceptable because they result \nfrom rounding errors.)\n3. 0 … P(x) … 1 for every individual value of the random variable x. (That is, \neach probability value must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.)\nThe second requirement comes from the simple fact that the random variable x \nrepresents all possible events in the entire sample space, so we are certain (with prob-\nability 1) that one of the events will occur. The third requirement comes from the basic \nprinciple that any probability value must be 0 or 1 or a value between 0 and 1.\nEXAMPLE 1  Genetics\nAlthough the Chapter Problem involves 945 births, let’s consider a simpler example \nthat involves only two births with the following random variable:\nx = number of girls in two births\nThe above x is a random variable because its numerical values depend on chance. \nWith two births, the number of girls can be 0, 1, or 2, and Table 5-1 is a probability \ncontinued\n","page_start":201,"page_end":201,"token_count":580,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":5,"chapter_title":"DISCRETE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","chunk_index":215}

Notice that it is similar to a relative frequency histogram (de-\nscribed in Section 2-2), but the vertical scale shows probabilities instead of relative \nfrequencies based on actual sample results.\ndistribution because it gives the probability for each value of the random variable x \nand it satisfies the three requirements listed earlier:\n \n1.

If the values of x are integers, round m, s, \nand s2 to one decimal place.\nExceptions to Round-Off Rule In some special cases, the above round-off rule re-\nsults in values that are misleading or inappropriate. For example, with four-engine \njets the mean number of jet engines working successfully throughout a flight is \n3.999714286, which becomes 4.0 when rounded, but that is misleading because it \nsuggests that all jet engines always work successfully. Here we need more precision to \ncorrectly  reflect the true mean, such as the precision in 3.999714.\nExpected Value\nThe mean of a discrete random variable x is the theoretical mean outcome for infinitely \nmany trials. We can think of that mean as the expected value in the sense that it is the \naverage value that we would expect to get if the trials could continue indefinitely.\nDEFINITION\nThe expected value of a discrete random variable x is denoted by E, and it is the \nmean value of the outcomes, so E = m and E can also be found by evaluating \nΣ 3x # P1x24, as in Formula 5-1.\nCAUTION An expected value need not be a whole number, even if the different \npossible values of x might all be whole numbers.

Because the probability of getting 879 or more girls is \nless than or equal to 0.05, we conclude that 879 girls in 945 births is a significantly \nhigh number of girls.

When computing the mean from a frequency distribu-\ntion, f represents class frequency and N represents population size. In the expression \nbelow, we rewrite the formula for the mean of a frequency table so that it applies to a \npopulation. In the fraction f>N, the value of f is the frequency with which the value x \noccurs and N is the population size, so f>N is the probability for the value of x.

Having concluded that the given procedure does result in a binomial distribu-\ntion, we now proceed to identify the values of n, x, p, and q.\n \n 1. With 5 oﬀspring peas, we have n = 5.\n2. We want the probability of exactly 3 peas with green pods, so x = 3.\n3. The probability of success (getting a pea with a green pod) for one selec-\ntion is 0.75, so p = 0.75.\n4. The probability of failure (not getting a green pod) is 0.25, so q = 0.25.\nAgain, it is very important to be sure that x and p both refer to the same concept of \n“success.” In this example, we use x to count the number of peas with green pods, \nso p must be the probability that a pea has a green pod. Therefore, x and p do use \nthe same concept of success (green pod) here.\nNot at Home\nPollsters cannot \nsimply ignore \nthose who were \nnot at home \nwhen they \nwere called \nthe first time. \nOne solution \nis to make repeated callback \nattempts until the person can \nbe reached.  Alfred Politz and \nWillard Simmons describe a way \nto compensate for those missed \ncalls without making repeated \ncallbacks. They suggest weight-\ning results based on how often \npeople are not at home. For \nexample, a person at home only \ntwo days out of six will have a  \n2>6 or 1>3 probability of being at \nhome when called the first time. \nWhen such a person is reached \nthe first time, his or her results \nare weighted to count three \ntimes as much as someone who \nis always home. This weighting \nis a compensation for the other \nsimilar people who are home two \ndays out of six and were not at \nhome when called the first time. \nThis clever solution was first \npresented in 1949.\n","page_start":213,"page_end":213,"token_count":857,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":5,"chapter_title":"DISCRETE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","chunk_index":227}

If 75% of peas have green pods \nand five offspring peas are generated, we expect to get around 5 # 0.75 = 3.8 peas \nwith green pods. This result can be generalized as m = np.

He claimed that \n75%, or 435, of them would have green pods. The actual experiment resulted in \n428 peas with green pods.\na. Assuming that groups of 580 oﬀspring peas are generated, ﬁnd the mean and \nstandard deviation for the numbers of peas with green pods.\n \nb. Use the range rule of thumb to ﬁnd the numbers of peas with green pods that \nseparate signiﬁcantly low values and signiﬁcantly high values from values that \nare not signiﬁcant. Based on those numbers, can we conclude that Mendel’s \nactual result of 428 peas with green pods is signiﬁcantly low or signiﬁcantly \nhigh? Does this suggest that Mendel’s value of 75% is wrong?\nSOLUTION\na. With n = 580 oﬀspring peas, with p = 0.75, and q = 0.25, we can ﬁnd \nthe mean and standard deviation for the numbers of peas with green pods as \n follows:\n         m = np = 1580210.752 = 435.0\ns = 1npq = 21580210.75210.252 = 10.4\nFor groups of 580 oﬀspring peas, the mean number of peas with green pods is \n435.0 and the standard deviation is 10.4.\nb. We must now interpret the results to determine whether Mendel’s actual result \nof 428 peas is a result that could easily occur by chance, or whether that result \nis so unlikely that the assumed rate of 75% is wrong. We will use the range \nrule of thumb as follows:\nSignificantly low values … 1m - 2s2 = 435.0 - 2110.42 = 414.2\nSignificantly high values Ú 1m + 2s2 = 435.0 + 2110.42 = 455.8\nINTERPRETATION\nBased on these results, significantly low values are 414.2 or lower, and significantly \nhigh values are 455.8 or higher. That is, if Mendel generated many groups of 580 \noffspring peas and if his 75% rate is correct, the numbers of peas with green pods \nshould usually fall between 414.2 and 455.8. Mendel actually got 428 peas with \ngreen pods, and that value is neither significantly low nor significantly high, so the \nexperimental results are consistent with the 75% rate.

In a traditional algebra course, we might conclude that 428 is not 75% \nof 580 simply because 428 does not equal 435 (which is 75% of 580). However, in \nstatistics we recognize that sample results vary. We don’t expect to get exactly 75% of \nthe peas with green pods. We recognize that as long as the results don’t vary too far \naway from the claimed rate of 75%, they are consistent with that claimed rate of 75%.\nIn this section we presented easy procedures for finding values of the mean m and \nstandard deviation s from a binomial probability distribution. However, it is really \nimportant to be able to interpret those values by using such tools as the range rule of \nthumb for distinguishing values that are significantly low or significantly high from \nvalues that are not significant.\nInstead of the range rule of thumb, we could also use probabilities to determine \nwhen values are significantly high or significantly low.\nUsing Probabilities to Determine When Results Are Significantly High or Low\n \n■Significantly high number of successes: x successes among n trials is a \n significantly high number of successes if the probability of x or more successes \nis 0.05 or less. That is, x is a significantly high number of successes if  \nP(x or more) … 0.05.*\n \n■Significantly low number of successes: x successes among n trials is a \n significantly low number of successes if the probability of x or fewer successes  \nis 0.05 or less. That is, x is a significantly low number of successes if  \nP(x or fewer) … 0.05.*\n*The value 0.05 is not absolutely rigid. Other values, such as 0.01, could be used to distinguish between results \nthat are signiﬁcant and those that are not signiﬁcant.\nRationale for the Binomial Probability Formula\nThe binomial probability formula is the basis for all three methods presented in this \nsection. Instead of accepting and using that formula blindly, let’s see why it works.\nIn Example 2, we used the binomial probability formula to find the probability \nof getting exactly 3 peas with green pods when 5 offspring peas are generated. With \nP(green pod) = 0.75, we can use the multiplication rule from Section 4-2 to find the \nprobability that the first 3 peas have green pods while the last 2 peas do not have green \npods. We get the following result:\nP13 peas with green pods followed by 2 peas with pods that are not green2\n = 0.75 # 0.75 # 0.75 # 0.25 # 0.25\n = 0.753 # 0.252\n = 0.0264\nThis result gives a probability of generating five offspring in which three have green pods. \nHowever, it does not give the probability of getting exactly three peas with green pods be-\ncause it assumes a particular arrangement for three offspring peas with green pods. Other \narrangements for generating three offspring peas with green pods are possible.\nIn Section 4-6 we saw that with three subjects identical to each other (such as peas \nwith green pods) and two other subjects identical to each other (such as peas without \ngreen pods), the total number of arrangements, or permutations, is 5!> 3 15 - 32!3!4, \nor 10. Each of those 10 different arrangements has a probability of 0.753 # 0.252, so the \ntotal probability is as follows:\nP13 peas with green pods among 52 =\n5!\n15 - 32!3! # 0.753 # 0.252\n","page_start":218,"page_end":218,"token_count":814,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":6,"chapter_title":"NORMAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","chunk_index":232}

Fur-\nther assume that each of the couples will be subjected to a \ntreatment that supposedly increases the likelihood that the \nchild will be a girl. Assume that with no treatment, the prob-\nability of a baby being a girl is 0.488, which is currently the \ncorrect value in the United States.\nThere is a danger in obtaining results first, then making \nconclusions about the results. If the results are close to show-\ning the effectiveness of a treatment, it might be tempting to \n conclude that there is an effect when, in reality, there is no ef-\nfect. It is better to establish criteria before obtaining results.\na. Using the methods of this chapter, identify the criteria that \nshould be used for concluding that the treatment is effective in in-\ncreasing the likelihood of a girl. Among the 75 births, how many \ngirls would you require in order to conclude that the gender selec-\ntion procedure is effective? Explain how you arrived at this result.\nb.

A value above -1.00 is considered \nto be in the “normal” range of bone density readings.\nSOLUTION\nWe again find the desired probability by finding a corresponding area.

Referring to the page with negative z scores, we find that \nthe cumulative area from the left up to z = -1.00 is 0.1587, as shown in Figure \n6-6. Because the total area under the curve is 1, we can find the shaded area by \nsubtracting 0.1587 from 1. The result is 0.8413.

(Table A-2 lists \nz-scores in the left column and across the top row, but areas are found in the body of \nthe table.) We should also remember that z scores positioned in the left half of the \ncurve are always negative. If we already know a probability and want to find the cor-\nresponding z score, we use the following procedure.\nProcedure for Finding a z Score from a Known Area\n1. Draw a bell-shaped curve and identify the region under the curve that corre-\nsponds to the given probability. If that region is not a cumulative region from the \nleft, work instead with a known region that is a cumulative region from the left.\n2. Use technology or Table A-2 to find the z score. With Table A-2, use the cu-\nmulative area from the left, locate the closest probability in the body of the \ntable, and identify the corresponding z score.\nSpecial Cases In the solution to Example 6 that follows, Table A-2 leads to a z score \nof 1.645, which is midway between 1.64 and 1.65. When using Table A-2, we can \nusually avoid interpolation by simply selecting the closest value. The accompanying \ntable lists special cases that are often used in a wide variety of applications. (For one \nof those special cases, the value of z = 2.576 gives an area slightly closer to the area \nof 0.9950, but z = 2.575 has the advantage of being the value exactly midway be-\ntween z = 2.57 and z = 2.58.) Except in these special cases, we can usually select \nthe closest value in the table. (If a desired value is midway between two table values, \nselect the larger value.) For z scores above 3.49, we can use 0.9999 as an approxima-\ntion of the cumulative area from the left; for z scores below -3.49, we can use 0.0001 \nas an approximation of the cumulative area from the left.\nSpecial Cases in Table A-2\n \n \nz Score\nCumulative  \nArea from  \nthe Left\n 1.645\n0.9500\n-1.645\n0.0500\n 2.575\n0.9950\n-2.575\n0.0050\nAbove 3.49\n0.9999\nBelow -3.49\n0.0001\n0\nArea 5 0.95\nz 5 ?\nFIGURE 6-9  Finding the 95th Percentile\nEXAMPLE 6  Bone Density Test: Finding a Test Score \nUse the same bone density test scores used in earlier examples.

Com-\nmon critical values are z = -1.96 and z = 1.96, and they are obtained as shown in \nExample 7. In Example 7, values of z = -1.96 or lower are significantly low because \nonly 2.5% of the population have scores at or below -1.96, and the values at or above \nz = 1.96 are significantly high because only 2.5% of the population have scores at or \nabove 1.96. Critical values will become extremely important in subsequent chapters. \nThe following notation is used for critical z values found by using the standard normal \ndistribution.\nDEFINITION \nFor the standard normal distribution, a critical value is a z score on the borderline \nseparating those z scores that are significantly low or significantly high.\nCAUTION When finding a value of za for a particular value of a, note that a is the \narea to the right of za, but Table A-2 and some technologies give cumulative areas \nto the left of a given z score. To find the value of za, resolve that conflict by using \nthe value of 1 - a. For example, to find z0.1, refer to the z score with an area of 0.9 \nto its left.\nNotation \nThe expression za denotes the z score with an area of a to its right. (a is the Greek \nletter alpha.)\nEXAMPLE 8  Finding the Critical Value zA \nFind the value of z0.025. (Let a = 0.025 in the expression za.)\nSOLUTION\nThe notation of z0.025 is used to represent the z score with an area of 0.025 to its \nright. Refer to Figure 6-10 and note that the value of z = 1.96 has an area of 0.025 \nto its right, so z0.025 = 1.96.

All of the examples in this section involved sam-\npling with replacement. Sampling without replacement would have the very practi-\ncal advantage of avoiding wasteful duplication whenever the same item is selected \nmore than once. Many of the statistical procedures discussed in the following chapters \nare based on the assumption that sampling is conducted with replacement because of \nthese two very important reasons:\n1. When selecting a relatively small sample from a large population, it makes no \nsignificant difference whether we sample with replacement or without replace-\nment.\n2. Sampling with replacement results in independent events that are unaf-\nfected by previous outcomes, and independent events are easier to analyze \nand result in simpler calculations and formulas.\nStatistical Literacy and Critical Thinking\n1. Births There are about 11,000 births each day in the United States, and the proportion of \nboys born in the United States is 0.512.

Do you think the births are randomly selected with replacement or without replacement?\nb. Give two reasons why statistical methods tend to be based on the assumption that sampling \nis conducted with replacement, instead of without replacement.\n3.  Unbiased Estimators Data Set 3 “Births” in Appendix B includes birth weights of \n400 babies. If we compute the values of sample statistics from that sample, which of the \nfollowing statistics are unbiased estimators of the corresponding population parameters: \nsample mean; sample median; sample range; sample variance; sample standard deviation; \nsample proportion?\n4. Sampling Distribution Data Set 3 “Births” in Appendix B includes a sample of birth \nweights.

Assume that weights of men are normally \ndistributed with a mean of 189 lb and a standard deviation of 39 lb (based on Data Set 1 “Body \nData” in Appendix B). The water taxi that sank had a stated capacity of 25 passengers, and the \nboat was rated for a load limit of 3500 lb.\na. Given that the water taxi that sank was rated for a load limit of 3500 lb, what is the maxi-\nmum mean weight of the passengers if the boat is filled to the stated capacity of 25 passengers?\nb. If the water taxi is filled with 25 randomly selected men, what is the probability that their \nmean weight exceeds the value from part (a)?\nc. After the water taxi sank, the weight assumptions were revised so that the new capacity be-\ncame 20 passengers.

Is the new capacity of 20 passengers safe?\n16. Designing Manholes According to the website www.torchmate.com, “manhole covers \nmust be a minimum of 22 in. in diameter, but can be as much as 60 in. in diameter.” Assume \nthat a manhole is constructed to have a circular opening with a diameter of 22 in. Men have \nshoulder breadths that are normally distributed with a mean of 18.2 in. and a standard deviation \nof 1.0 in. (based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).\na. What percentage of men will fit into the manhole?\nb. Assume that Connecticut’s Eversource company employs 36 men who work in manholes. If \n36 men are randomly selected, what is the probability that their mean shoulder breadth is less \nthan 18.5 in.?

Histogram: Construct a histogram. If the histogram departs dramatically from a \nbell shape, conclude that the data do not have a normal distribution.\n2. Outliers: Identify outliers. If there is more than one outlier present, conclude \nthat the data might not have a normal distribution. (Just one outlier could be an \nerror or the result of chance variation, but be careful, because even a single out-\nlier can have a dramatic effect on results.)\n3. Normal quantile plot: If the histogram is basically symmetric and the num-\nber of outliers is 0 or 1, use technology to generate a normal quantile plot. \nApply the following criteria to determine whether the distribution is nor-\nmal. (These criteria can be used loosely for small samples, but they should \nbe used more strictly for large samples.)\n Normal Distribution: The population distribution is normal if the pattern of \nthe points is reasonably close to a straight line and the points do not show some \nsystematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern.\n Not a Normal Distribution: The population distribution is not normal if either \nor both of these two conditions apply:\n • The points do not lie reasonably close to a straight line.\n • The points show some systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern.\nHistograms and Normal Quantile Plots\nIn Part 2 of this section we describe the process of constructing a normal quantile plot, \nbut for now we focus on interpreting a normal quantile plot. The following displays \nshow histograms of data along with the corresponding normal quantile plots.\nNormal: The first case shows a histogram of IQ scores that is close to being bell-\nshaped, so the histogram suggests that the IQ scores are from a normal distribution. \nThe corresponding normal quantile plot shows points that are reasonably close to a \nstraight-line pattern, and the points do not show any other systematic pattern that is \nnot a straight line. It is safe to assume that these IQ scores are from a population that \nhas a normal distribution.\nDEFINITION\nA normal quantile plot (or normal probability plot) is a graph of points (x, y) \nwhere each x value is from the original set of sample data, and each y value is the \ncorresponding z score that is expected from the standard normal distribution.\n","page_start":280,"page_end":280,"token_count":507,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":6,"chapter_title":"NORMAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","chunk_index":296}

If the histo-\ngram is roughly bell-shaped and the number of outliers is 0 or 1, treat the popula-\ntion as if it has a normal distribution.\n \n■Normal Quantile Plot: Normal quantile plots can be difficult to construct on \nyour own, but they can be generated with suitable technology.\n \n■Advanced Methods: In addition to the procedures discussed in this section, \nthere are other more advanced procedures for assessing normality, such as the \nchi-square goodness-of-fit test, the Lilliefors test, the Anderson-Darling test, the \nJarque-Bera test, and the Ryan-Joiner test (discussed briefly in Part 2).\nPART 2\nManual Construction of Normal  \nQuantile Plots\nThe following is a relatively simple procedure for manually constructing a normal \nquantile plot, and it is the same procedure used by Statdisk and the TI-83>84 Plus cal-\nculator.

Estimates of \nimprovement rates have typically \nranged between one-third and \ntwo-thirds of patients. However, \na more recent study suggests \nthat placebos have no real ef-\nfect. An article in New England \nJournal of Medicine (Vol. 334, \nNo. 21) was based on research \nof 114 medical studies over \n50 years.

Using the known sample size n, find the values of 1\n2n, 3\n2n, 5\n2n, and so \non, until you get n values. These values are the cumulative areas to the left \nof the corresponding sample values.\nStep 3:  Use the standard normal distribution (software or a calculator or Table A-2) \nto find the z scores corresponding to the cumulative left areas found in Step 2. \n(These are the z scores that are expected from a normally distributed sample.)\nStep 4:  Match the original sorted data values with their corresponding z scores \nfound in Step 3; then plot the points (x, y), where each x is an original sam-\nple value and y is the corresponding z score.\nStep 5:  Examine the normal quantile plot and use the criteria given in Part 1. Con-\nclude that the population has a normal distribution if the pattern of the \npoints is reasonably close to a straight line and the points do not show some \nsystematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern.\nEXAMPLE 1  Platelet Counts\nConsider this sample of five patient platelet counts (1000 cells>mL): 125, 229, 236, \n257, 234.

One \ncommon transformation is to transform each value of x by taking its logarithm. (You \ncan use natural logarithms or logarithms with base 10. If any original values are 0, \ntake logarithms of values of x + 1). If the distribution of the logarithms of the values \nis a normal distribution, the distribution of the original values is called a lognormal \ndistribution. (See Exercises 19 “Transformations” and 20 “Lognormal Distribu-\ntion”.) In addition to transformations with logarithms, there are other transformations, \nsuch as replacing each x value with 1x, or 1>x, or x2. In addition to getting a required \nnormal distribution when the original data values are not normally distributed, such \ntransformations can be used to correct deficiencies, such as a requirement (found in \nlater chapters) that different data sets have the same variance.\nLet’s use the display with the three criteria for assessing normality.\n \n1. Histogram: We can see that the histogram is skewed to the left instead of  \nbeing bell-shaped.\n \n2. Outliers: The display shows that there are 20 possible outliers.

Here are the two main points of this section:\n \n■Given probabilities p and q (where q = 1 - p) and sample size n, if the condi-\ntions np Ú 5 and nq Ú 5 are both satisfied, then probabilities from a binomial \nprobability distribution can be approximated reasonably well by using a normal \ndistribution having these parameters:\n m = np\n s = 1npq.\n \n■The binomial probability distribution is discrete (with whole numbers for the \nrandom variable x), but the normal approximation is continuous. To compensate, \nwe use a “continuity correction” with a whole number x represented by the inter-\nval from x - 0.5 to x + 0.5.\nBrief Review of Binomial Probability Distribution In Section 5-2 we saw that \na binomial probability distribution has (1) a fixed number of trials; (2) trials that are \nindependent; (3) trials that are each classified into two categories commonly referred \nto as success and failure; and (4) trials with the property that the probability of success \nremains constant. Section 5-2 also introduced the following notation.\nNotation\nn = the ﬁxed number of trials\nx = the specific number of successes in n trials\np = probability of success in one of the n trials\nq = probability of failure in one of the n trials (so q = 1 - p)\nRationale for Using a Normal Approximation We saw in Section 6-3 that the \nsampling distribution of a sample proportion tends to approximate a normal distribu-\ntion. Also, see the probability histogram on the next page for the binomial distribution \nwith n = 580 and p = 0.25. (In one of Mendel’s famous hybridization experiments, \nhe expected 25% of his 580 peas to be yellow.) The bell shape of this graph suggests \nthat we can use a normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution.\n6-6 \nNormal as Approximation to Binomial\n","page_start":287,"page_end":287,"token_count":634,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":7,"chapter_title":"ESTIMATING PARAMETERS AND DETERMINING SAMPLE SIZES","chunk_index":303}

First, elevators commonly have a 25% margin of error, \nso they can safely carry a load that is 25% greater than the \nstated load. What amount is 25% greater than 2500 pounds? \nLet’s refer to this amount as “the maximum safe load,” \nwhile the 2500-pound limit is the “placard maximum load.”\nb. Now we need to determine the maximum number of pas-\nsengers that should be allowed. Should we base our calcula-\ntions on the maximum safe load or the 2500-pound placard \nmaximum load?\nc. The weights given in the accompanying table are weights \nof adults not including clothing or textbooks. Add another \n10 pounds for each student’s clothing and textbooks.

One good answer is sufficient \nhere.)\n2. Out-of-class activity Divide into groups of three or four students. In each group, develop \nan original procedure to illustrate the central limit theorem. The main objective is to show that \nwhen you randomly select samples from a population, the means of those samples tend to be \nnormally distributed, regardless of the nature of the population distribution.

A confidence interval gives us a much better sense of how good \nan estimate is.\nEXAMPLE 1\nTouch Therapy\nThe Chapter Problem describes a test of touch therapy. If the touch therapists had \nthe ability to sense a human energy field, they should have identified the correct \nhand significantly more than 50% of the time. If they made random guesses, their \nsuccess rate should be around 50%. Using the result of 123 correct responses in the \n280 trials, find the best point estimate of the proportion of correct responses.\nSOLUTION\nBecause the sample proportion is the best point estimate of the population propor-\ntion, we conclude that the best point estimate of p is 123>280 or 0.439. (If using \nthe sample results to estimate the percentage of correct responses, the best point \n estimate is 43.9%.)\nDEFINITION\nA confidence interval (or interval estimate) is a range (or an interval) of values \nused to estimate the true value of a population parameter. A confidence interval is \nsometimes abbreviated as CI.\nDEFINITION\nThe confidence level is the probability 1 - a (such as 0.95, or 95%) that the con-\nfidence interval actually does contain the population parameter, assuming that the \nestimation process is repeated a large number of times. (The confidence level is \nalso called the degree of confidence, or the confidence coefficient.)\nThe following table shows the relationship between the confidence level and the cor-\nresponding value of a.

The Pew \nResearch Center studied this \nissue by comparing results from \nonline polls to polls that included \nthe offline population.

(See Exercise 37 for dealing with cases in which \na relatively large sample is selected without replacement from a finite population, so \nthe sample size n does depend on the population size N.)\nPART 2\nBetter-Performing Confidence Intervals \nDisadvantage of Wald Confidence Interval\nCoverage Probability The coverage probability of a confidence interval is the ac-\ntual proportion of such confidence intervals that contain the true population propor-\ntion. If we select a specific confidence level, such as 0.95 (or 95%), we would like to \nget the actual coverage probability equal to our desired confidence level. However, for \nthe confidence interval described in Part 1 (called a “Wald confidence interval”), the \nactual coverage probability is usually less than or equal to the confidence level that we \nselect, and it could be substantially less. For example, if we select a 95% confidence \nlevel, we usually get 95% or fewer of confidence intervals containing the population \nproportion p. (This is sometimes referred to as being “too liberal.”) For this reason, \nthe Wald confidence interval is rarely used in professional applications and profes-\nsional journals.\nBetter-Performing Confidence Intervals\nImportant note about exercises: Except for some Beyond the Basics exercises, the \nexercises for this Section 7-1 are based on the method for constructing a Wald con-\nfidence interval as described in Part 1, not the confidence intervals described here. It \nis recommended that students learn the methods presented earlier, but recognize that \nthere are better methods available, and they can be used with suitable technology.\nINTERPRETATION\nTo be 95% confident that our sample percentage is within three percentage points \nof the true percentage for all children, we should obtain a simple random sample of \n1068 children, assuming no prior knowledge. By comparing this result to the sam-\nple size of 385 found in part (a), we can see that if we have no knowledge of a prior \nstudy, a larger sample is required to achieve the same results compared to when the \nvalue of pn can be estimated.\nCAUTION Try to avoid these three common errors when calculating sample size:\n1.

Don’t make the mistake of \nreplacing za>2 with 0.95 or 0.05.\n3.  Be sure to round up to the next higher integer; don’t round oﬀ using the usual \nround-oﬀ rules.

The distribution need not be perfectly bell-shaped, but it should appear to be \nsomewhat symmetric with one mode and no outliers.\nSample Size n + 30 This is a common guideline, but sample sizes of 15 to 30 are \nadequate if the population appears to have a distribution that is not far from being \nnormal and there are no outliers. For some population distributions that are extremely \nfar from normal, the sample size might need to be larger than 30. This text uses the \nsimplified criterion of n 7 30 as justification for treating the distribution of sample \nmeans as a normal distribution.\nStudent t Distribution\nIn this section we use a Student t distribution, which is commonly referred to as a t distri-\nbution. It was developed by William Gosset (1876–1937), who was a Guinness Brewery \nemployee who needed a distribution that could be used with small samples. The brewery \nprohibited publication of research results, but Gosset got around this by publishing under \nthe pseudonym “Student.” Here are some key points about the Student t distribution:\n■Student t Distribution If a population has a normal distribution, then the distri-\nbution of\nt = x - m\ns\n1n\nis a Student t distribution for all samples of size n. A Student t distribution is \ncommonly referred to as a t distribution.\n■Degrees of Freedom Finding a critical value ta>2 requires a value for the degrees \nof freedom (or df). In general, the number of degrees of freedom for a collection \nof sample data is the number of sample values that can vary after certain restric-\ntions have been imposed on all data values. (Example: If 10 test scores have the \nrestriction that their mean is 80, then their sum must be 800, and we can freely \nassign values to the first 9 scores, but the 10th score would then be determined, \nso in this case there are 9 degrees of freedom.) For the methods of this section, \nthe number of degrees of freedom is the sample size minus 1.\nDegrees of freedom = n −1\n■Finding Critical Value tA,2 A critical value ta>2 can be found using technology \nor Table A-3. Technology can be used with any number of degrees of freedom, \nbut Table A-3 can be used for select numbers of degrees of freedom only. If using \nTable A-3 to find a critical value of ta>2, but the table does not include the exact \nnumber of degrees of freedom, you could use the closest value, or you could be \nconservative by using the next lower number of degrees of freedom found in the \ntable, or you could interpolate.\n■The Student t distribution is different for different sample sizes. (See Figure 7-4 \non the next page for the cases n = 3 and n = 12.)\n■The Student t distribution has the same general symmetric bell shape as the stan-\ndard normal distribution, but has more variability (with wider distributions), as \nwe expect with small samples.\n■The Student t distribution has a mean of t = 0 (just as the standard normal distri-\nbution has a mean of z = 0).\nst\nis\nbe \nre\nEstimating Wildlife \nPopulation Sizes\nThe National \nForest Man-\nagement \nAct protects \nendangered \nspecies, includ-\ning the northern \nspotted owl, \nwith the result that the for-\nestry industry was not allowed \nto cut vast regions of trees in \nthe Pacific Northwest.

When interpreting a confidence interval \nestimate of μ, know that the confidence level gives us the success rate of the procedure \nused to construct the confidence interval. For example, the 95% confidence interval \nestimate of 29.2 hg 6 m 6 32.5 hg can be interpreted as follows:\n“We are 95% conﬁdent that the interval from 29.2 hg to 32.5 hg actually \ndoes contain the true value of M.”\nBy “95% confident” we mean that if we were to select many different samples of the \nsame size and construct the corresponding confidence intervals, in the long run, 95% \nof the confidence intervals should actually contain the value of m.\nFinding a Point Estimate and Margin of Error E from a Confidence Interval\nTechnology and journal articles often express a confidence interval in a format such \nas (10.0, 30.0). The sample mean x is the value midway between those limits, and the \nUsing Technology Technology can be used to automatically construct the confi-\ndence interval. Shown here is the StatCrunch display resulting from the 15 birth \nweights. The display shows the lower confidence interval limit (29.247163) and \nthe upper confidence interval limit (32.486171).

Estimate the value of s by using the results of some other earlier study. In \naddition, we can sometimes be creative in our use of other known results. \nFor example, Wechsler IQ tests are designed so that the standard deviation \nis 15. Biostatistics students have IQ scores with a standard deviation less \nthan 15, because they are a more homogeneous group than people randomly \nselected from the general population. We do not know the specific value \nof s for Biostatistics students, but we can be safe by using s = 15. Using \na value for s that is larger than the true value will make the sample size \nlarger than necessary, but using a value for s that is too small would result \nin a sample size that is inadequate. When determining the sample size n, \nany errors should always be conservative in the sense that they make the \nsample size too large instead of too small.\nEXAMPLE 4  IQ Scores of Smokers\nAssume that we want to estimate the mean IQ score for the population of adults \nwho smoke. How many smokers must be randomly selected for IQ tests if we want \n95% confidence that the sample mean is within 3 IQ points of the population mean?\nSOLUTION\nFor a 95% confidence interval, we have a = 0.05, so za>2 = 1.96. Because we \nwant the sample mean to be within 3 IQ points of m, the margin of error is E = 3. \nAlso, we can assume that s = 15 (see the discussion that immediately precedes \nthis example). Using Formula 7-4, we get\nn = c\nza>2s\nE\nd\n2\n= c 1.96 # 15\n3\nd\n2\n= 96.04 = 97 1rounded up2\nINTERPRETATION\nAmong the thousands of adults who smoke, we need to obtain a simple random \nsample of at least 97 of their IQ scores. With a simple random sample of only 97 \nadult smokers, we will be 95% confident that the sample mean x is within 3 IQ \npoints of the true population mean m.\nPART 2\nEstimating a Population Mean  \nWhen S Is Known \nIn the real world of professional statisticians and professional journals and reports, it \nis extremely rare that we want to estimate an unknown value of a population mean m \nbut we somehow know the value of the population standard deviation s. If we some-\nhow do know the value of s, the confidence interval is constructed using the standard \nnormal distribution instead of the Student t distribution, so the same procedure from \nPart 1 can be used with this margin of error:\nMargin of error: E = za>2 # s\n1n 1used with known s2\n","page_start":325,"page_end":325,"token_count":626,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":7,"chapter_title":"ESTIMATING PARAMETERS AND DETERMINING SAMPLE SIZES","chunk_index":342}

(The Greek letter x is pronounced \n“kigh.”)\nChi-Square Distribution\nHere are key points about the x2(chi-square or chi-squared) distribution:\n \n■In a normally distributed population with variance s2, if we randomly select in-\ndependent samples of size n and, for each sample, compute the sample variance \ns2, the sample statistic x2 = 1n - 12s2>s2 has a sampling distribution called \nthe chi-square distribution, as shown in Formula 7-5.\n7-3 \nEstimating a Population Standard Deviation or Variance\nFORMULA 7-5\nx2 = 1n - 12s2\ns2\n \n■Critical Values of X2 We denote a right-tailed critical value by x2\nR and we de-\nnote a left-tailed critical value by x2\nL.

All of those methods have certain \nrequirements that limit the situations in which they can be used. When some of the require-\nments are not satisfied, we can often use the bootstrap method to estimate a parameter with \na confidence interval. The bootstrap method typically requires the use of software.\nSampling Requirement The preceding methods of this chapter all have a require-\nment that the sample must be a simple random sample. If the sample is not collected \nin an appropriate way, there’s a good chance that nothing can be done to get a us-\nable confidence interval estimate of a parameter. Bootstrap methods do not correct for \npoor sampling methods.\nRequirements Listed below are important requirements from the preceding sections \nof this chapter:\n \n■CI for Proportion (Section 7-1): There are at least 5 successes and at least 5 \nfailures, or np Ú 5 and nq Ú 5.\n \n■CI for Mean (Section 7-2): The population is normally distributed or n 7 30.\n \n■CI for S or S2 (Section 7-3): The population must have normally distributed \nvalues, even if the sample is large.\nWhen the above requirements are not satisfied, we should not use the methods pre-\nsented in the preceding sections of this chapter, but we can use the bootstrap method \ninstead. The bootstrap method does not require large samples. This method does not \nrequire the sample to be collected from a normal or any other particular distribution, \nand so it is called a nonparametric or distribution-free method; other nonparamet-\nric methods are included in Chapter 13.\n7-4 \nBootstrapping: Using Technology for Estimates\n","page_start":342,"page_end":342,"token_count":759,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":8,"chapter_title":"HYPOTHESIS TESTING","chunk_index":362}

The term “bootstrap” is used because the data “pull \nthemselves up by their own bootstraps” to generate new data sets. In days of yore, \n“pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps” meant that an impossible task was somehow \naccomplished, and the bootstrap method described in this section might seem impos-\nsible, but it works!\nHow Many? In the interest of providing manageable examples that don’t occupy mul-\ntiple pages each, the examples in this section involve very small data sets and no more \nthan 20 bootstrap samples, but we should use at least 1000 bootstrap samples when \nwe use bootstrap methods in serious applications. Professional statisticians commonly \nuse 10,000 or more bootstrap samples.\nBootstrap Procedure for a Confidence Interval Estimate of a Parameter\n1. Given a simple random sample of size n, obtain many (such as 1000 or more) \nbootstrap samples of the same size n.\n2. For the parameter to be estimated, find the corresponding statistic for each \nof the bootstrap samples. (Example: For a confidence estimate of m, find the \n sample mean x from each bootstrap sample.)\n3. Sort the list of sample statistics from low to high.\nDEFINITION\nGiven a simple random sample of size n, a bootstrap sample is another random \nsample of n values obtained with replacement from the original sample.\nCAUTION Note that a bootstrap sample involves sampling with replacement, so \nthat when a sample value is selected, it is replaced before the next selection is \nmade.\nWithout replacement, every sample would be the same as the original sample, so the \nproportions or means or standard deviations or variances would all be the same, and \nthere would be no confidence “interval.”\nEXAMPLE 1  Bootstrap Sample of Incomes\nWhen one of the authors collected annual incomes of current statistics students, he \nobtained these results (in thousands of dollars): 0, 2, 3, 7.\nOriginal Sample\nBootstrap Sample\n0\n7\n2\n2\n3\n2\n7\n3\nThe sample of {7, 2, 2, 3} is one bootstrap sample obtained from the original sam-\nple. Other bootstrap samples may be different.\nIncomes tend to have distributions that are skewed instead of being normal, so \nwe should not use the methods of Section 7-2 with a small sample of incomes. This \nis a situation in which the bootstrap method comes to the rescue.\nhe\nHow Many People  \nDo You Know?\nIt’s difficult for \nanyone to count \nthe number \nof people he \nor she knows, \nbut statistical \nmethods can \nbe used to estimate the mean \nnumber of people that we all \nknow. The simple approach of \njust asking someone how many \npeople are known has worked \npoorly in the past. A much \nbetter approach is to select a \nrepresentative sample of people \nand ask each person how many \npeople he or she knows who \nare named Marc, Mario, Jason, \nGinny, Rachel, or Todd. (Uncom-\nmon names are more effective \nbecause people with more com-\nmon names are more difficult to \naccurately recall.) Responses \nare then used to project the total \nnumber of people that are known. \n(If sample subjects know a mean \nof 1.76 people with those names, \nand we know that 0.288% of the \npopulation has those names, \nthen the mean number of people \nknown is 1.76>0.00288 = 611.) \nAccording to one estimate, the \nmean number of people known \nis 611, and the median is 472. \n(See “How Many People Do \nYou Know?

Each student should simulate 20 births by drawing \n20 cards from a shuffled deck. Replace each card after it has been drawn, then reshuffle. Consider \nthe hearts to be girls and consider all other cards to be boys. After making 20 selections and record-\ning the “genders” of the babies, construct a confidence interval estimate of the proportion of girls. \nDoes the result appear to be effective in identifying the true value of the population proportion?

In Part 1, we begin with the “big \npicture” to understand the basic underlying approach to hypothesis tests. Then we de-\nscribe null and alternative hypotheses, significance level, types of tests (two-tailed, \nleft-tailed, right-tailed), test statistic, P-value, critical values, and statements of conclu-\nsions. In Part 2 we describe types of errors (type I and type II). In Part 3 we describe \nthe power of a hypothesis test.\nPART 1\n Basic Concepts of Hypothesis Testing\nWe begin with two very basic definitions.\n8-1 \nBasics of Hypothesis Testing\nTesting a Claim About a Standard Deviation or Variance\n• Develop the ability to use sample data to conduct a formal hypothesis test of a claim \nmade about a population standard deviation or variance.

The \naccompanying screen displays show results from different technologies, so we can use \ncomputers or calculators to do all of the computational heavy lifting. Examining the \nscreen displays, we see some common elements. They all display a “test statistic” of \nz = 26.45 (rounded), and they all include a “P-value” of 0.0000 (rounded).

The null hypothesis includes the working \nassumption for the purposes of conducting the test.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe null hypothesis (denoted by H0) is a statement that the value of a popula-\ntion parameter (such as proportion, mean, or standard deviation) is equal to some \nclaimed value.\nThe alternative hypothesis (denoted by H1 or Ha or HA) is a statement that the pa-\nrameter has a value that somehow differs from the null hypothesis. For the methods \nof this chapter, the symbolic form of the alternative hypothesis must use one of \nthese symbols: 6, 7, ≠.\nThe term null is used to indicate no change or no effect or no difference. We conduct \nthe hypothesis test by assuming that the parameter is equal to some specified value so \nthat we can work with a single distribution having a specific value.\nExample: Here is an example of a null hypothesis involving a proportion:\nH0: p = 0.5\nExample: Here are different examples of alternative hypotheses involving proportions:\nH1: p 7 0.5  H1: p 6 0.5  H1: p ≠0.5\nGiven the claim from Example 1 that the gender selection method is effective in \nincreasing the probability that a baby will be a girl, we can apply Steps 1, 2, and 3 in \nFigure 8-1 as follows.\nStep 1:  Identify the claim to be tested and express it in symbolic form. Using p to \ndenote the probability of selecting a girl, the claim that the gender selection is effec-\ntive can be expressed in symbolic form as p 7 0.5.\nStep 2:  Give the symbolic form that must be true when the original claim is false. If \nthe original claim of p 7 0.5 is false, then p … 0.5 must be true.\nStep 3:  This step is in two parts: Identify the alternative hypothesis H1 and identify \nthe null hypothesis H0.\n• Identify H1: Using the two symbolic expressions p 7 0.5 and p … 0.5, the alter-\nnative hypothesis H1 is the one that does not contain equality. Of those two ex-\npressions, p 7 0.5 does not contain equality, so we get\nH1: p 7 0.5\n• Identify H0: The null hypothesis H0 is the symbolic expression that the parameter \nequals the fixed value being considered, so we get\nH0: p = 0.5\nThe result of the first three steps is the identification of the null and alternative \nhypotheses:\nH0: p = 0.5 1null hypothesis2\nH1: p 7 0.5 1alternative hypothesis2\n","page_start":359,"page_end":359,"token_count":680,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":8,"chapter_title":"HYPOTHESIS TESTING","chunk_index":384}

(In this section, only Exercises 33–35 involve power.)\nPower and the Design of Experiments\nJust as 0.05 is a common choice for a significance level, a power of at least 0.80 is a \ncommon requirement for determining that a hypothesis test is effective. (Some statisti-\ncians argue that the power should be higher, such as 0.85 or 0.90.) When designing an \nexperiment, we might consider how much of a difference between the claimed value of a \nparameter and its true value is an important amount of difference. If testing the effective-\nness of the XSORT gender selection method, a change in the proportion of girls from \n0.5 to 0.501 is not very important, whereas a change in the proportion of girls from 0.5 \nto 0.9 would be very important. Such magnitudes of differences affect power. When de-\nsigning an experiment, a goal of having a power value of at least 0.80 can often be used \nto determine the minimum required sample size, as in the following example.\nthe value assumed in the null hypothesis H0: p = 0.5. Find the values of power cor-\nresponding to these alternative values of p: 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9.\nSOLUTION\nThe values of power in the following table were found by using Minitab, and exact \ncalculations are used instead of a normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\nSpecific Alternative Value of p\nb\nPower of Test = 1 −b\n0.6\n0.820\n0.180\n0.7\n0.564\n0.436\n0.8\n0.227\n0.773\n0.9\n0.012\n0.988\nINTERPRETATION\nOn the basis of the power values listed above, we see that this hypothesis test has a \npower of 0.180 (or 18.0%) of rejecting H0: p = 0.5 when the population proportion \np is actually 0.6. That is, if the true population proportion is actually equal to 0.6, \nthere is an 18.0% chance of making the correct conclusion of rejecting the false null \nhypothesis that p = 0.5. That low power of 18.0% is not so good.\nThere is a 0.436 probability of rejecting p = 0.5 when the true value of p is \nactually 0.7. It makes sense that this test is more effective in rejecting the claim \nof p = 0.5 when the population proportion is actually 0.7 than when the popula-\ntion proportion is actually 0.6. (When identifying animals assumed to be horses, \nthere’s a better chance of rejecting an elephant as a horse—because of the greater \ndifference—than rejecting a mule as a horse.)

(Both the P-value method and the critical value \nmethod use the same standard deviation based on the claimed proportion p, so they \nare equivalent to each other, but the confidence interval method uses an estimated \nstandard deviation based on the sample proportion.) Recommendation: Use a confi-\ndence interval to estimate a population proportion, but use the P-value method or criti-\ncal value method for testing a claim about a proportion. See Exercise 30.\nClaim: The XSORT Method of Gender Selection  \nIs Effective\nLet’s use the preliminary results from tests of the XSORT method of gender selection. \nThose preliminary results consisted of 14 babies born to couples using the XSORT \nmethod of gender selection, and 13 of the babies were girls. Use these results to test \nthe claim that most babies born to couples using the XSORT method are girls. We \ninterpret “most” to mean “more than half” or “greater than 0.5.”\nREQUIREMENT CHECK We first check the three requirements.\n1. The 14 babies are not randomly selected, but based on the design of the clinical \ntrial, they can be treated as being random.\n2. There is a fixed number (14) of independent trials with two categories (the baby \nis a girl or is not).\n3. The requirements np Ú 5 and nq Ú 5 are both satisfied with n = 14, \np = 0.5, and q = 0.5. [The value of p = 0.5 comes from the claim. We \nget np = 114210.52 = 7, which is greater than or equal to 5, and we get \nnq = 114210.52 = 7, which is also greater than or equal to 5.]\nThe three requirements are satisfied. \nSolution: P-Value Method\nTechnology Computer programs and calculators usually provide a P-value, so the \nP-value method is used. Different technologies will display the test statistic of \nz = 3.21 and the P-value of 0.0007.\nTable A-2 If technology is not available, Figure 8-1 on page 340 in the preceding sec-\ntion lists the steps for using the P-value method. Using those steps from Figure 8-1, \nwe can test the claim that “most babies born to couples using the XSORT method are \ngirls” as follows.\nStep 1: The original claim is that the XSORT method is effective in increasing the like-\nlihood of a baby girl, and that claim can be expressed in symbolic form as p 7 0.5.\nStep 2: The opposite of the original claim is p … 0.5.\nStep 3: Of the preceding two symbolic expressions, the expression p 7 0.5 does not \ncontain equality, so it becomes the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the state-\nment that p equals the fixed value of 0.5.

When using the critical value method with the claim that \n“most babies born to couples using the XSORT method are girls,” Steps 1 through \n5 are the same as Steps 1 through 5 for the P-value method, as shown. We continue \nwith Step 6 of the critical value method.\nStep 6: The test statistic is computed to be z = 3.21, as shown for the preceding \nP-value method. With the critical value method, we now find the critical values (in-\nstead of the P-value). This is a right-tailed test, so the area of the critical region is an \narea of a = 0.05 in the right tail. Referring to Table A-2 and applying the methods \nof Section 6-1, we find that the critical value is z = 1.645, which is at the boundary \nof the critical region, as shown in Figure 8-6.\nStep 7: Because the test statistic does fall within the critical region, we reject the null \nhypothesis.\nStep 8: Because we reject H0: p = 0.5, we conclude that there is sufficient sample \nevidence to support the claim that for couples using the XSORT gender selection \nmethod, most (more than half) of their babies are girls.\nSolution: Confidence Interval Method\nThe claim that “with the XSORT method of gender selection, most babies are girls” is \na claim that can be tested with a 0.05 significance level by constructing a 90% confi-\ndence interval. (See Table 8-1 on page 340 to see why the 0.05 significance level cor-\nresponds to a 90% confidence interval.)\nThe 90% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion p is found \nusing the sample data consisting of n = 14 and pn = 13>14. Using the methods of \n Section 7-1 we get: 0.815 6 p 6 1.042. The entire range of values in this confidence \ninterval is greater than 0.5. Because we are 90% confident that the limits of 0.815 and \n1.042 contain the true value of p, the sample data appear to support the claim that \nmost (more than 0.5) XSORT babies are girls. In this case, the conclusion is the same \nas with the P-value method and the critical value method, but that is not always the \ncase. It is possible that a conclusion based on the confidence interval can be different \nfrom the conclusion based on the P-value method or critical value method.\nFinding the Number of Successes x\nWhen using technology for hypothesis tests of proportions, we must usually enter \nthe sample size n and the number of successes x, but in real applications the sample \nproportion pn is often given instead of x. The number of successes x can be found by \nevaluating x = npn, as illustrated in Example 1. Note that in Example 1, the result of \n5587.712 adults must be rounded to the nearest whole number of 5588.\nCAUTION: Don’t confuse the following notation.\n•  P-value = probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the one repre-\nsenting the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis H0 is true\n• p = population proportion\n• pn = sample proportion\n-\nIs 0.05 a Bad Choice?\nThe value of \n0.05 is a very \ncommon choice \nfor serving as \nthe cutoff sepa-\nrating results \nconsidered to \nbe significant from those that are \nnot.

What is the actual number of adults who have sleepwalked?\nSOLUTION\nThe number of adults who have sleepwalked is 29.2% of 19,136, or 0.292 * 19,136\n= 5587.712, but the result must be a whole number, so we round the product to the \nnearest whole number of 5588.\nCAUTION When conducting hypothesis tests of claims about proportions, slightly \ndifferent results can be obtained when calculating the test statistic using a given \nsample proportion instead of using a rounded value of x found by using x = npn.\nEXAMPLE 2  Fewer Than 30% of Adults Have Sleepwalked\nUsing the same sleepwalking data from Example 1 (n = 19,136 and pn = 29.2%),  \nwould a reporter be justified in stating that “fewer than 30% of adults have sleep-\nwalked”? Let’s use a 0.05 significance level to test the claim that for the adult popu-\nlation, the proportion of those who have sleepwalked is less than 0.30.\nSOLUTION\nREQUIREMENT CHECK (1) The sample is a simple random sample. (2) There is a \nfixed number (19,136) of independent trials with two categories (a subject has \nsleepwalked or has not). (3) The requirements np Ú 5 and nq Ú 5 are both satisfied \nwith n = 19,136 and p = 0.30. [We get np = 119,136210.302 = 5740.8, which \nis greater than or equal to 5, and we also get nq = 119,136210.702 = 13,395.2, \nwhich is greater than or equal to 5.] The three requirements are all satisfied. \nStep 1: The original claim is expressed in symbolic form as p 6 0.30.\nStep 2: The opposite of the original claim is p Ú 0.30.\nStep 3: Because p 6 0.30 does not contain equality, it becomes H1. We get\nH0: p = 0.30 1null hypothesis2\nH1: p 6 0.30 1alternative hypothesis and original claim2\nStep 4: The significance level is a = 0.05.\nStep 5: Because the claim involves the proportion p, the statistic relevant to this test \nis the sample proportion pn and the sampling distribution of sample proportions can \nbe approximated by the normal distribution.\nStep 6: Technology If using technology, the test statistic and the P-value will be \nprovided. See the following results from StatCrunch showing that the test statistic is \nz = -2.41 (rounded) and the P-value = 0.008.\n","page_start":376,"page_end":376,"token_count":665,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":8,"chapter_title":"HYPOTHESIS TESTING","chunk_index":403}

In Step 7 we would reject the null hypothesis \nbecause the test statistic of z = -2.41 would fall within the critical region bounded by \nz = -1.645. We would then reach the same conclusion given in Example 2.\nConfidence Interval Method If we were to repeat Example 2 using the confidence \ninterval method, we would use a 90% confidence level because we have a left-tailed \ntest. (See Table 8-1.) We get this 90% confidence interval: 0.287 6 p 6 0.297.

Also, this exact approach does not require that np Ú 5 and \nnq Ú 5, so we have a method that applies when that requirement is not satisfied. To \ntest hypotheses using the exact method, find P-values as follows:\nExact Method Identify the sample size n, the number of successes x, and the claimed \nvalue of the population proportion p (used in the null hypothesis); then find the P-value \nby using technology for finding binomial probabilities as follows:\nLeft-tailed test:   P-value = P1x or fewer successes among n trials2\nRight-tailed test:   P-value = P1x or more successes among n trials2\nTwo-tailed test:   P-value =  twice the smaller of the preceding left-tailed and \nright-tailed values\nNote: There is no universally accepted method for the above two-tailed exact case, \nso this case can be treated with other different approaches, some of which are quite \ncomplex. For example, Minitab uses a “likelihood ratio test” that is different from the \nabove approach that is commonly used.\nEXAMPLE 3  Using the Exact Method\nIn testing a method of gender selection, 10 randomly selected couples are treated \nwith the method, they each have a baby, and 9 of the babies are girls. Use a 0.05 \nsignificance level to test the claim that with this method, the probability of a baby \nbeing a girl is greater than 0.75.\nSOLUTION\nREQUIREMENT CHECK The normal approximation method described in Part 1 of \nthis section requires that np Ú 5 and nq Ú 5, but nq = (10)(0.25) = 2.5, so the \nrequirement is violated. The exact method has only the requirements of being a \nsimple random sample and satisfying the conditions for binomial distribution, and \nthose two requirements are satisfied. \nHere are the null and alternative hypotheses:\nH0: p = 0.75 1null hypothesis2\nH1: p 7 0.75 1alternative hypothesis and original claim2\nInstead of using the normal distribution, we use technology to find probabilities in a \nbinomial distribution with p = 0.75. Because this is a right-tailed test, the P-value \nis the probability of 9 or more successes among 10 trials, assuming that p = 0.75. \nSee the following Statdisk display of exact probabilities from the binomial distri-\nbution. This Statdisk display shows that the probability of 9 or more successes is \n0.2440252 when rounded to seven decimal places, so the P-value is 0.2440252. The \nP-value is high (greater than 0.05), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is \nnot sufficient evidence to support the claim that with the gender selection method, \nthe probability of a girl is greater than 0.75.\n","page_start":378,"page_end":378,"token_count":635,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":8,"chapter_title":"HYPOTHESIS TESTING","chunk_index":405}

This section deals with the very realistic and com-\nmonly used case in which the population standard deviation s is not known.\nIn reality, it is very rare that we test a claim about an unknown value of a popula-\ntion mean m but we somehow know the value of the population standard deviation s. \nThe realistic situation is that we test a claim about a population mean and the value of \nthe population standard deviation s is not known. When s is not known, we estimate \nit with the sample standard deviation s. From the central limit theorem (Section 6-4), \nwe know that the distribution of sample means x is approximately a normal distribu-\ntion with mean mx = m and standard deviation sx = s> 1n, but if s is unknown, we \nestimate s> 1n with s> 1n, which is used in the test statistic for a “t test.” This test \nstatistic has a distribution called the Student t distribution. The requirements, test \nstatistic, P-value, and critical values are summarized in the Key Elements box that \nfollows.\nEquivalent Methods\nFor the t test described in this section, the P-value method, the critical value method, \nand the confidence interval method are all equivalent in the sense that they all lead to \nthe same conclusions.\n8-3 \nTesting a Claim About a Mean\n","page_start":384,"page_end":384,"token_count":707,"section_type":"other","chapter_number":8,"chapter_title":"HYPOTHESIS TESTING","chunk_index":413}
